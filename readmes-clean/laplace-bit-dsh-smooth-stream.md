# dsh-smooth-stream

**dsh-smooth-stream** is a [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) community plugin for **silky streaming** in the Web UI: arrival-tracking typewriter reveal, glide-in wraps, no flicker. It is not part of the official DeepSeek distribution.

## What it does

- **Reveal tracks the model.** Assistant text appears at a cadence that follows the arrival rate. Fast bursts do not dump a whole paragraph; a slow stream does not sit still and then jump.
- **Markdown stays markdown.** Code, emphasis, and the rest render while the reply is still coming. There is no plain-text tail that later swaps into formatted markdown.
- **Wraps glide in.** A new line or a growing tool card eases into view instead of snapping the transcript up by a line.
- **You keep the scroll.** Scroll up to read earlier text and the overlay lets go. Follow resumes only when you return to the bottom — the to-bottom button counts.
- **Think stays the built-in row.** Reasoning uses the usual disclosure. It opens while thinking is the live tail and closes when thinking ends; the chevron still toggles by hand.
- **The rest of the turn moves with it.** Running tool cards, model retries, and workflow runs share the same follow, so the whole turn slides instead of only the assistant text.
- **It backs off when it should.** `prefers-reduced-motion` shows the finished text at once and does not take follow. If the frame rate drops below 30 fps and the reply is off-screen, reveal pauses and catches up when the view is healthy again.

## Install

From a DeepSeek Harness source checkout:

```sh
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add github:Laplace-bit/dsh-smooth-stream
```

If `dsh` is already on your `PATH`:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Laplace-bit/dsh-smooth-stream
```

The first `add` is expected to fail. Git install has to run this package's `prepare` script, and pnpm ≥10 blocks that until you allow it. Open `~/.dsh/profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml` and add the snippet pnpm printed. On current pnpm that is:

```yaml
onlyBuiltDependencies:
  - dsh-smooth-stream
```

Then run the same `add` again.

Start the UI:

```sh
pnpm dsh web
```

The Host log should include `[dsh-smooth-stream] plugin loaded!`.

Remove it with `pnpm dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-smooth-stream` (or `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-smooth-stream`).

## Configuration

The bundle installs with `preset: balanced`. Change it in the profile `cordis.patch.yml` if you want a different cadence:

### `preset` · Feel
- **`preset`**: `realtime` · **Feel**: Keeps closer to the model
- **`preset`**: `balanced` · **Feel**: Default
- **`preset`**: `silky` · **Feel**: More buffer, slower catch-up

`maxScrollSpeedPxPerSec` (default `1000`) is a ceiling so the first large lag does not teleport.

## FAQ

**Is this an official DeepSeek plugin?**
No. It is a community plugin for the DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) Web UI, MIT-licensed, and not part of the official DeepSeek distribution.

**How do I install a DeepSeek Harness plugin?**
Use the built-in plugin command: `dsh plugin --profile web add github:Laplace-bit/dsh-smooth-stream` from a dsh source checkout (see [Install](#install) for the pnpm ≥10 build-script note).

**Can I install it from npm?**
Not yet - the plugin currently installs from GitHub. Watch this repository for npm availability.

**Does it respect `prefers-reduced-motion`?**
Yes. With reduced motion enabled the finished text is shown at once and the plugin does not take over follow. If the frame rate drops below 30 fps while the reply is off-screen, reveal pauses and catches up later.
