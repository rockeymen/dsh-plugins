## Publish your plugin here

1. Check [docs/REVIEW.md](docs/REVIEW.md) for the format and the safety red lines.
2. Either PUT your tarball to the public submission box, or install whale-submit and do it from a session.
3. Review is transparent: submissions are publicly readable; verdicts are posted publicly.

## Help improve it

This store is built in public and it needs crew feedback:

- Ideas and questions: [Discussions](https://github.com/WhaleHarness/WhaleHarness/discussions) (Ideas / Q&A)
- Bugs and problems: [Issues](https://github.com/WhaleHarness/WhaleHarness/issues)
- Fixes and improvements: open a PR — review is the same transparent process as plugin submissions
- Review appeals: every rejection note lists exactly what to fix; re-submit when done

## Repository layout

- `plugins/` — cordis bundle sources (three files each: package.json, cordis.patch.yml, lib/index.js)
- `skills/` — SKILL.md sources
- `dist/plugins.json` — the live store manifest (sha256-checked)
- `deploy/` — nginx site config, stats aggregator, press-page generator
- `docs/REVIEW.md` — review checklist used for every submission
- `ROUNDS.md` — the public build log: every round of work, including the mistakes

## The build log

The site was built live, round by round, with the process recorded in [ROUNDS.md](ROUNDS.md) and replayed as an async text livestream at https://whaleharness.com/live.html — every pitfall documented actually broke a boot.
