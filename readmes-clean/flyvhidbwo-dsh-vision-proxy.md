# dsh-vision-proxy

**Keep DeepSeek as the brain — paste images anyway.** GUI image attachments auto-transcribed for text-only DeepSeek on [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

## Why this exists

DeepSeek Harness natively gates image attachments on the selected model's declared `inputModalities`. DeepSeek's chat-completions line is text-only, so attaching an image with DeepSeek selected is rejected by design. Tool-based vision plugins exist, but **GUI image attachments still fail** with a text-only model.

This plugin closes that gap: it registers a new provider route (`deepseek-vision`) that wraps the real DeepSeek adapter, claims image input (so the preflight admits attachments), and **transcribes every attached image to text in the request stream** before delegating to DeepSeek. The conversation is still answered by DeepSeek; vision is an add-on.

## Features

- **No hangs, ever.** Anonymous endpoints are hard-capped at 20 s (a hanging free tier can no longer stall a turn for minutes); HTTP 429 on anonymous endpoints fails immediately instead of sleeping on a useless `Retry-After`; endpoints that just failed (429/timeout) are cooled down for 60 s and skipped.
- **Multi-model, multi-provider.** Any OpenAI-compatible VLM endpoint works — DashScope/Qwen, QwenCloud (international), Zhipu, OpenRouter, local Ollama, or your own. Each `fallbackModels` entry can carry its **own** `baseURL`/`model`, so one install can chain providers.
- **Zero-config local path.** With `autoLocalOllama` (default on), a running Ollama at `http://localhost:11434` is detected at startup and prepended to the fallback chain — images never leave your machine. No key, no account.
- **Fast, clear failures.** With no key and no local Ollama, transcription fails in seconds with actionable guidance (configure `VISION_API_KEY` / `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` or install Ollama) — never a silent stall.
- **Automatic upgrade when you have a key.** Export `VISION_API_KEY` / `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and your configured paid endpoint is used automatically (default: DashScope `qwen3.7-flash` — fast, cheap, no rate limit; DashScope, QwenCloud, Zhipu, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint all work); keyless entries are skipped, not failed.
- **Install-time consent prompt.** `postinstall` asks whether you have a VLM API key. Non-interactive environments skip the prompt; the install never hangs. A PRIVACY NOTICE is printed at startup naming the active endpoint.
- **Fallback chain with classified errors.** `rate_limit` / `quota` / `auth` / `region` / `model_not_found` / `context_too_large` / `http` are classified with actionable hints.
- **Content-hash cache.** Transcriptions are cached by the SHA-256 of the image bytes (in-process, capped at 200) — the same image is transcribed at most once per process, even re-attached or in another conversation.
- **Auto-downscale (optional).** With `sharp` installed, images above `maxImagePixels` are downscaled before transcription — fewer image tokens, much faster on big screenshots. Degrades gracefully without sharp.
- **`read_image` compatible.** The native `read_image` tool also works on this route (its capability gate reads the same model info).

## Supported models & providers

One config (`baseURL` + `model`, optionally `apiKey`) covers every backend:

### Scenario · baseURL · model · Notes
- **Scenario**: **DashScope (China)** — default main · **baseURL**: `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` · **model**: `qwen3.7-flash` / `qwen3-vl-flash` · **Notes**: Cheap, fast, no rate limit. Keys: `sk-ws-…` from [platform.qianwenai.com](https://platform.qianwenai.com) or `sk-…` from [bailian.console.aliyun.com](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com)
- **Scenario**: **Local Ollama (auto-detected)** · **baseURL**: `http://localhost:11434/v1` · **model**: first vision-capable model · **Notes**: Zero config when installed; images never leave the machine
- **Scenario**: **QwenCloud (intl.)** · **baseURL**: `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` · **model**: `qwen3-vl-plus` etc. · **Notes**: International variant
- **Scenario**: **Zhipu (free tier)** · **baseURL**: `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` · **model**: `glm-4.6v-flash` · **Notes**: Free tier, still needs a (free) Zhipu API key
- **Scenario**: **Anything OpenAI-compatible** · **baseURL**: your endpoint · **model**: your model · **Notes**: OpenRouter, Ark, vLLM, gateways… the plugin only speaks `/chat/completions`

> ⚠️ **Anonymous third-party free tiers are NOT bundled as a default fallback.** In field testing, anonymous free endpoints (e.g. OVHcloud AI Endpoints) were strictly rate-limited AND occasionally hung without a response — as a default they just reproduce a broken experience. If you still want to point at one, add it yourself via `fallbackModels` with `anonymous: true` (the 20 s cap still applies).

**Key resolution order**: config `apiKey` → `$VISION_API_KEY` → `$DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`. Anonymous endpoints (`anonymous: true`) and local hosts need no key; keyless non-anonymous entries are skipped automatically.

## Quick start

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-vision-proxy
```

During install you are asked one question — *do you have a VLM API key?* Answer `y` for the paid fast path, or `N` (default) for the local/zero-config path. Restart `dsh web`, pick **DeepSeek + 自动识图** in the model selector, then paste an image into any conversation.

**pnpm ≥ 10 blocks dependency build scripts by default** — the first install exits non-zero with `Ignored build scripts: dsh-vision-proxy, sharp`. Approve both (the plugin's consent prompt and `sharp`'s optional binary), then re-run the install to finish bundle registration:

```yaml
# in the profile's pnpm-workspace.yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-vision-proxy: true
  sharp: true
```

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-vision-proxy   # re-run after approving
```

> **Slow npm registry in China?** `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-vision-proxy --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com` (the flag is forwarded to pnpm).

## Live demo: a real GUI image turn

A real conversation on the `deepseek-vision` route (DeepSeek-V4-Flash as the brain): the user pasted a meme and asked **"你看到了什么"** (what do you see?); the image was auto-transcribed by the VLM and DeepSeek answered from the text — one step, ~7.6 s.

  ![The model picker showing the deepseek-vision route (DeepSeek + 自动识图) selected](assets/demo-selector.png)
  ![DeepSeek](assets/demo-reply.png)

*Left: the model picker showing the `deepseek-vision` route (**DeepSeek + 自动识图**) selected — that is what admits image attachments. Right: DeepSeek's full answer derived from the transcribed image text.*

```
user pastes a meme image + "你看到了什么"
  → image block auto-transcribed via the VLM (OCR + layout):
      "我是吃白饭的 / 蓝色大肥鱼！ (理直气壮.jpg) — Q-version blue-haired maid girl
       with a whale tail, holding a bowl of rice and chopsticks, excited expression"
  → DeepSeek answers with a full visual analysis of the meme
```

Two autonomous paths are covered: the `view_image` tool (any route, file paths & URLs) and image-block auto-transcription (on the `deepseek-vision` route — images you attach mid-conversation).

## Configuration

The bundle already ships sensible defaults (see the strategy above) — you normally don't need to configure anything. To override them in your profile, use an **id-targeted override**, NOT an `insert` (see the warning below):

```yaml
# $DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml — user-layer override example
- id: dsh-vision-proxy
  name: 'dsh-vision-proxy'
  config:
    baseURL: https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
    apiKey: 'sk-…'          # or leave '' to read env vars (writing it here is the reliable way on Windows)
    model: qwen3.7-flash
    maxTokens: 4096
    timeoutMs: 120000       # anonymous endpoints are hard-capped at 20 s anyway
    maxImagePixels: 4000000
    marker: '[图片转译]'
    autoLocalOllama: true
    fallbackModels: []      # add your own {model, baseURL, apiKey?, anonymous?, timeoutMs?}
```

> ⚠️ **Do NOT write this as `- insert: [{id: dsh-vision-proxy, …}]`.** In dsh's patch semantics an `insert` **appends** entries to the list — the bundle's own entry and yours (same id) would both be instantiated, registering the `deepseek-vision` adapter **twice** (undefined behavior). A top-level `- id:` entry targets the existing row and **replaces its whole `config`**; keys you omit fall back to the plugin schema's `.default()` values (e.g. `maxTokens=4096`, `timeoutMs=120000`, `autoLocalOllama=true`), so writing only `apiKey`/`model` also works.

### Key · Default · Meaning
- **Key**: `providerId` · **Default**: `deepseek-vision` · **Meaning**: Route id shown in the model picker
- **Key**: `innerProvider` · **Default**: `deepseek-official` · **Meaning**: Existing adapter route to wrap
- **Key**: `baseURL` · **Default**: DashScope compatible-mode · **Meaning**: OpenAI-compatible VLM endpoint (any vendor, Ollama included)
- **Key**: `apiKey` · **Default**: `''` · **Meaning**: VLM key; falls back to `$VISION_API_KEY`, then `$DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`. On Windows, environment changes may not reach a running dsh — writing `apiKey` here is the reliable way
- **Key**: `anonymous` · **Default**: `false` · **Meaning**: Skip the Authorization header (for registration-free endpoints; 20 s timeout cap applies)
- **Key**: `model` · **Default**: `qwen3.7-flash` · **Meaning**: Vision model id (e.g. `Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct`, `qwen3-vl-flash`, `glm-4.6v-flash`, `qwen3-vl:4b`)
- **Key**: `maxTokens` · **Default**: `4096` · **Meaning**: VLM output cap (thinking models spend tokens on reasoning first)
- **Key**: `timeoutMs` · **Default**: `120000` · **Meaning**: VLM request timeout (anonymous endpoints are capped at 20 s regardless)
- **Key**: `maxImagePixels` · **Default**: `4000000` · **Meaning**: Images above this are downscaled before transcription when `sharp` is installed (0 disables)
- **Key**: `marker` · **Default**: `[图片转译]` · **Meaning**: Marker prepended to each transcription
- **Key**: `autoLocalOllama` · **Default**: `true` · **Meaning**: Probe `http://localhost:11434` at startup; when found, prepend it to the fallback chain
- **Key**: `localOllamaModel` · **Default**: `''` · **Meaning**: Ollama model id; empty picks the first vision-capable model the local Ollama reports
- **Key**: `fallbackModels` · **Default**: `[]` · **Meaning**: Ordered fallback list `{model, baseURL?, apiKey?, anonymous?, timeoutMs?}` — each entry may point at a **different provider**; keyless non-anonymous entries are skipped

> **About API keys on Windows**: `dsh --profile <name> --dump-config` prints the composed config as-is (so a key in `cordis.patch.yml` shows in plaintext dumps), but environment variables set after a process started (explorer.exe caches them) may never reach a running dsh. If you see `skipped — no API key` despite having exported the key, **write `apiKey` directly into the plugin config** — it is the only reliable path on Windows. (Note: dsh rc.6 does NOT load `.env` files, so that is not an alternative.)

## Verify the install

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A3 dsh-vision-proxy   # exactly ONE entry (note: dumps config in plaintext, key included)
```

1. Restart `dsh web` → the model picker shows **DeepSeek + 自动识图**.
2. Paste an image into a conversation → you should see the `[图片转译]` marker followed by DeepSeek's answer.
3. With no key and no local Ollama, the turn should fail **fast** (seconds) with the guidance message — that is the intended no-hang behavior.

## Behavior notes

- Only messages containing image blocks are touched; plain-text conversations hit DeepSeek with zero overhead.
- Anonymous endpoints: 20 s hard timeout cap, HTTP 429 fails immediately (no retry), failures arm a 60 s endpoint cooldown — consecutive images don't re-hit a broken endpoint.
- The request only fails after every chain entry failed, with one error listing each attempt plus actionable guidance.
- Transcription results are cached in-process by image content hash (never persisted).
- On startup the plugin logs a one-line summary — route id, wrapped provider, VLM model, endpoint, timeout, maxTokens, apiKey source and fallback list (the key itself is never logged), plus a PRIVACY NOTICE and a local-Ollama detection line.
- Tested: 14 unit tests on Node 22 and 24 via GitHub Actions (incl. no-hang fast-fail, cooldown skip, and Ollama detection).
- Transcription quality: dense UI screenshots may lose small text details — that is the vision model's capability ceiling, not a plugin bug. For OCR-heavy work, use a stronger model (e.g. `qwen3-vl-plus`) or raise `maxTokens`.

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom · Cause & fix
- **Symptom**: `skipped — no API key` despite exporting `VISION_API_KEY` · **Cause & fix**: Windows caches environment variables in explorer.exe; the running dsh never saw them. Write `apiKey` directly into the plugin config, then restart dsh
- **Symptom**: `Ignored build scripts: dsh-vision-proxy, sharp` on install · **Cause & fix**: pnpm ≥ 10 blocks dependency build scripts. Add `allowBuilds: {dsh-vision-proxy: true, sharp: true}` to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, then re-run the install
- **Symptom**: `ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION` on a fresh release day · **Cause & fix**: pnpm 11 defaults `minimumReleaseAge` to 1 day (supply-chain policy). Add `minimumReleaseAge: 0` to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, or pass `--config.minimum-release-age=0` to `dsh plugin add`, then re-run
- **Symptom**: `all N vision model(s) failed … rate_limit` on an anonymous endpoint · **Cause & fix**: Anonymous free tiers are strictly rate-limited and may hang. Configure a key or use local Ollama
- **Symptom**: Turn stalls ~20 s then fails on a fresh install with no key · **Cause & fix**: No key and no local Ollama — that is the intended fast-fail path. Install Ollama or add a key
- **Symptom**: Slow downloads from registry.npmjs.org · **Cause & fix**: Use `--registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com` (forwarded to pnpm)

## Privacy

Transcription sends image bytes (base64, over HTTPS) to the configured VLM endpoint — **the image data leaves your machine** unless `baseURL` points at a local service (e.g. Ollama). Nothing is stored beyond the harness's own attachment store. For sensitive images, use your own endpoint or a local model — or don't install.

## How it works (for plugin developers)

The plugin uses only public harness seams, stable on rc.6:

- `ctx.llm.registration(innerProvider).adapter` — reach the wrapped adapter;
- `ctx.llm.registerAdapter([providerId], proxyAdapter)` — register a NEW route (no `DUPLICATE_ADAPTER` conflict);
- proxy `resolveModel` overrides `inputModalities` to `['text', 'image']` — satisfies the attachment preflight (`api-proxy`) and the `read_image` gate (`dsh-tool-fs`);
- proxy `stream` transcribes image blocks (shape `{ type: 'image', attachment }`, bytes via `ctx.get('attachments').readImage(ref)`) and `yield*`s the inner adapter's stream unchanged.
