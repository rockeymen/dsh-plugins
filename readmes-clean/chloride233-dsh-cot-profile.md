# dsh-cot-profile

Real-time chain-of-thought trajectory profiling for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): watch the reasoning stream as it happens, tally signature wording indicators (`let me` / `we` / `let's` / `I`), classify the current session's trajectory family against built-in baselines, and optionally record per-session measurement aggregates.

## Read this first: honest framing

Wording fingerprints describe the **(model × assembly) combination** — system prompt, tool schema, reasoning effort — **not model identity**. The underlying research ([`xiaobright/modeltest`](https://github.com/xiaobright/modeltest)) shows the same wording pattern across different models when the interface changes (the V4 Flash counterexample: identical `we`-heavy, `let me`-free reasoning under the minimal assembly, at a different ability level).

[`yjh051108/dsh-router-standard`](https://github.com/yjh051108/dsh-router-standard) maps the same lexicon onto a **fault line**: along the persona axis, V4 Pro behavior collapses into three bands — **spec** (collective `We`, let me ≈ 0), a **transition band** (`mixed`: `We`/`The`/`Let` mixing, unstable), and **react** (first-person `The`/`Let`, we ≈ 0). Neither side is universally "stronger" (maintenance tasks favor the spec side; greenfield builds favor the react side). The author's own correction note rejects any reading of the wording as model identity or capability proof.

This plugin tells you **which trajectory side the current session behaves like** (spec-like / react-like / gray-like), flags the **transition band explicitly as "不确定"** instead of forcing a label, and shows you the raw indicators side by side, so you draw your own conclusions. It does not assert "this is model X".

## Features

- **Live UI**: session-header badge + collapsible floating panel, updated by session-projection push frames — no polling, no custom RPC.
- **Indicators**: `let me` / `we` / `let's` / `I` counts, first-line patterns (`We need…` / `The user wants…` / `Let me…` / `I…`), block-length median, interim visible replies.
- **Judgment**: weighted-distance match against built-in profile baselines with confidence; verdicts only after N blocks (default 10, configurable). Trajectories that cannot be reliably assigned — low confidence, or both `we` and `let me` elevated (the router-standard **transition band**) — are reported as "过渡带 / 不确定" instead of a possibly-wrong hard label.
- **Extensible**: user-editable profile families and per-dimension weights (Web settings or cordis config).
- **Record mode**: one aggregate JSON record per session at session end (event and/or JSONL) — the measurement instrument that calibrates the baselines with real data.
- **Privacy**: only aggregates ever leave the host computation; raw reasoning text is never recorded or transmitted.

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Chloride233/dsh-cot-profile
```

The core plugin (badge, panel, records) works immediately. The **Web settings section** additionally needs a temporary one-time patch to DeepSeek Harness 0.1.0-rc.6 (see [Optional: Web settings](#optional-web-settings-section)); without it, configure via cordis config below.

## Configure

Configuration lives in the `cot-profile` plugin row (`cordis.patch.yml` of this repo, or your profile's cordis.yml). Defaults:

```yaml
- id: cot-profile
  config:
    minBlocksForJudgment: 3    # verdict after N reasoning blocks (3 default; confidence+transition guard short tasks)
    badge: true                # session-header badge
    panel: true                # real-time panel
    panelMode: overlay         # 'overlay' (default, zero risk) | 'track' (experimental right column)
    weights: {}                # per-dimension weights; {} = built-in defaults
    profiles: []               # custom profile families; [] = built-in baselines
    record:
      emit: true               # emit cot-profile/record at session end
      file: ''                 # optional JSONL path (leading ~ expands to $HOME)
```

**Panel modes:**

- `overlay` (default): floating panel pinned to the right edge of the conversation — an official additive slot, zero risk.
- `track` (**experimental**): a real right column appended to the shell's three-column grid via direct DOM manipulation (MutationObserver over `grid-template-columns`). It does not cover content and does not replace any shipped UI, but it operates outside the official slot system — a DSH upgrade that changes the frame structure may require adapting this mode. Off by default.

Weights (defaults, `let me`/`we` dominate per research separation):

```json
{ "letMe100": 3, "we100": 3, "lets100": 2, "i100": 1.5,
  "firstLineWeNeed": 1.5, "firstLineUserWants": 1, "firstLineLetMe": 1.5,
  "firstLineI": 1, "firstLineOther": 0.5, "p50BlockChars": 1, "visibleReplies": 1.5 }
```

A custom profile is `{ "id", "name", "description", "vector" }` with any of the vector dims; add one per model/version you want to track and judge against.

## Optional: Web settings section

DeepSeek Harness 0.1.0-rc.6 exposes only a hard-coded allowlist of settings namespaces to the browser (`WEB_SETTINGS_NAMESPACES` in `dsh-host-apiproxy`; its source comment calls moving that decision to `settings.register()` *deferred work*). Until upstream lands plugin-declared settings exposure, run:

```bash
sh scripts/install-patch.sh
```

This copies the installed `dsh-host-apiproxy` into the web profile and adds `cot-profile` to the allowlist. It is **idempotent and optional** — the plugin is fully functional without it. Caveats:

- A `pnpm install` in the profile directory removes the copied package; re-run the script afterwards.
- A dsh upgrade may change the allowlist layout; the patch script fails loudly (never silently) when it cannot find the block.

## FAQ

- **Local-path install fails to load?** `dsh plugin add <local-dir>` installs via pnpm's `link:` protocol, which resolves the linked package's imports from its own directory — so the checkout needs a resolvable `node_modules`. Run `pnpm install` in the checkout (or symlink it to the running harness's node_modules). Installing from the GitHub URL (`github:...`) does not have this issue — pnpm resolves dependencies from its store natively.

## Events & data

### Surface · Shape
- **Surface**: Projection key · **Shape**: `cot-profile` — read it in any session-scoped slot via `useProjection('cot-profile')` (typed as `CotProfileView` in `lib/index.d.ts`)
- **Surface**: `cot-profile/update` · **Shape**: `{ sessionId, blocks, counts, firstLines, p50BlockChars, visibleReplies, vector, judgment, ui, revision, seq }` (throttled 500ms)
- **Surface**: `cot-profile/record` · **Shape**: one aggregate record at session end (only when the session had ≥1 reasoning block)

### Record schema (v1)

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "...",
  "startedAt": 1720000000000,
  "endedAt": 1720000100000,
  "preset": "anchored-standard",        // when known (agent-preset/selected)
  "provider": "deepseek",               // when known (agent/request capture)
  "model": "deepseek-v4-pro",           // when known
  "reasoningBlocks": 193,
  "indicators": { "letMe": 1, "we": 179, "lets": 88, "i": 17,
                  "p50BlockChars": 111, "visibleReplies": 1,
                  "firstLines": { "we-need": 120, "other": 73 } },
  "vector": { /* normalized indicator vector */ },
  "judgment": { "family": "minimal-like", "confidence": 0.87, "distances": {},
                "mixed": false, "mixedReason": "" }
}
```

**Privacy boundary (hard requirement):** records contain only aggregates — never raw reasoning text. File recording is off by default and opt-in.

### GUI calibration (semi-automatic)

The settings section (**Settings → 思维链画像 → 数据校准**) scans the configured record file, groups records by (provider, model, preset), aggregates indicator-vector means per group, and offers a one-click **"应用为画像族"** — writing the measured group as a new profile-family into the `profiles` config. Aggregation is automatic; applying is always a human decision, and the built-in baselines are never rewritten automatically.

The scan reads `GET /cot-profile/records` — a route the plugin registers on the web server. It reads **only** the configured `record.file` path and returns aggregates (never raw reasoning text); without a configured file it returns an empty result. If the settings section shows a scan error, confirm the JSONL path is set and a few sessions have ended.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # node --test test/*.test.js (zero dependencies)
```

- `lib/analyzer.js` — pure analysis (tokenize, counts, first-line classes, vector, distance, judgment)
- `lib/profiles.js` — built-in baselines (marked **estimates** — calibrate with record-mode data)
- `lib/index.js` — host: session projection, events, record sink
- `lib/client.js` — badge, panel, settings section

## How the judgment is verified

Three layers, in increasing strength:

1. **Unit tests** (`test/analyzer.test.js`, `test/projection.test.js`) — the pure logic: tokenization, counts, vectors, weighted distance, transition-band detection. Deterministic, fast.
2. **Golden verification against real model data** (`test/golden-verify.test.js` + `test/golden/probes.csv`) — 119 real DeepSeek V4 Pro / V4 Flash single-request probe runs from [`yjh051108/dsh-router-standard`](https://github.com/yjh051108/dsh-router-standard) (MIT, see `test/golden/NOTICE`), each with a ground-truth lexicon classification and the same wording metrics this plugin consumes. Current results: **spec-side runs 83/83 judged spec-side (100%), zero direction errors, react-side runs never misjudged spec-side, ambiguous runs flagged as the transition band ≥55%**. This validates discrimination against real model behavior, not just self-consistency.
3. **End-to-end replay verification** (`scripts/replay-verify.mjs`) — replays a real DSH session log (`session.jsonl.zstd`) through the projection fold and cross-checks every statistic against an independent ground-truth tally over the raw reasoning texts. Verified on the session logs in this repo's history: **all reasoning blocks, counts, first-line patterns, and block-length medians match exactly**. This validates the monitoring chain (event stream → fold → stats) that unit tests cannot cover.
4. **Record-mode calibration** (see above) — the plugin's own session records accumulate per-model aggregates you can inspect in the settings UI and apply as measured baselines.

The honest limit: wording is a fault-line fingerprint, so "verified" here means *consistent with real model trajectories under known assemblies* — it cannot prove which model is running (no single-assembly wording can).

### Controlled probes (your environment, your assembly)

The golden data validates the judgment against someone else's probes; for **your** model, your harness, your task, run controlled probes:

1. **Pick a known assembly.** A spec-side trajectory comes from the minimal/RL-reduced assembly (`We` voice, let me ≈ 0); a react-side from a Standard/PTC-style assembly (`The`/`Let` voice); a mixed-side from an intermediate persona. The `dsh-router-standard` preset family is a ready source of both persona sides.
2. **Run one micro-task session per probe** — e.g. "inspect the repository, then locate and read the README" (the router probes' micro-task), one short task per session, reasoning visible.
3. **Export and verify:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/probe-verify.mjs --expect spec ~/.dsh/sessions/<ws>/<session>/session.jsonl.zstd
   node scripts/probe-verify.mjs --expect react --dir ~/.dsh/sessions/probe-react
   ```
   The script replays each log through the plugin's fold, reports the verdict per session, and fails on direction errors (a spec-expect session judged react-side, or vice versa). A transition-band verdict under a spec/react expectation is *conservative* (data-insufficient), not an error — consistent with the golden criteria.

## Upstream wishlist

Both are temporary gaps in DeepSeek Harness 0.1.0-rc.6 this plugin works around:

1. **Plugin-declared settings exposure** — move the settings namespace allowlist from `dsh-host-apiproxy` into `settings.register()` so plugins can expose their own configuration without patching a bundle.
2. **Additive right-column slot** — a `conversation.details.panel`-style list seat so a floating panel can become a native right column.
