# OpenGuardrails

**The vendor-neutral protocol for AI agent safety & security — and the neutral benchmark that ranks the vendors.**

Integrate safety & security once, enforce it across every agent, sandbox, and LLM — instead of wiring every vendor to every tool by hand.

Apache-2.0 · [openguardrails.com](https://openguardrails.com)

This monorepo is the home of the **OpenGuardrails (OGR) specification and its
reference implementations**. The specification is the normative contract every
adapter, detector, and sandbox speaks; the core runtimes, integrations,
benchmark, examples, skill, and website live alongside it so changes can be
reviewed and tested together.

OGR is **not a guardrail product**: it defines the wire and referees the
leaderboard. Vendors compete on detection quality behind a common plug; users
get one way to configure and compose safety & security across every agent they
run.

- We define the **wire** — events, verdicts, provenance, correlation, composition.
- We **referee** the benchmark.
- We do **not** build detection capability — vendors compete behind the contract.

## Why a standard

Without OGR, securing an agent is an `N × M × L × S` integration problem: every
agent, every detector vendor, every LLM protocol, every sandbox wired pairwise.
OGR collapses it to `N + M + L + S` — integrate once against the contract.

## Three layers: API → SDK → Plugin

Everything in this repo sits in one of three layers, each built on the one
below it:

| Layer | What it is | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **API** | The wire contract a runtime (PDP) exposes: `POST /v1/evaluate`, `POST /v1/ingest`, enrollment, heartbeat, config, approvals — carrying `GuardEvent`s and returning `Verdict`s. | [Runtime API binding](specification/runtime-api.md) + [JSON Schemas](schema/) |
| **SDK** | Language bindings that wrap the API — serialization, auth, request signing, batching — plus the in-process runtime for local evaluation. | [`packages/python`](packages/python/) (`openguardrails`), [`packages/javascript`](packages/javascript/) (`@openguardrails/core`) |
| **Plugin** | A hook for one surface — agent, gateway, sandbox, eBPF — that observes actions, builds events, and enforces verdicts, using an SDK for everything below. | [`integrations/`](integrations/) |

A plugin never speaks HTTP or hand-rolls wire mapping itself; that is the
SDK's job. An SDK never invents endpoints; the API is the single normative
surface.

## The normative components

| Component | What it defines | OTel analogue |
|---|---|---|
| [GuardEvent](specification/guard-event.md) | The typed unit observed at an interception point | span / log record |
| [Verdict](specification/verdict.md) | A detector's decision about an event | — |
| [Provenance](specification/provenance-and-context.md) | Trust/taint labels on every piece of context | — |
| [guard-context](specification/provenance-and-context.md#guard-context-propagation) | Correlation of one logical action across gateway / hook / sandbox | trace context (W3C `traceparent`) |
| [composition](specification/composition.md) | How multiple vendors' verdicts combine into one decision | — |
| [enrollment & receipts](specification/enrollment-and-receipts.md) | How PEPs authenticate to a runtime, and how approvals become verifiable payload-bound artifacts | — |
| [attestation](specification/attestation.md) | How strongly identity claims are verified — one ladder for subject assertions and channel auth, with gateway multiplexing guidance | — |
| [Runtime API](specification/runtime-api.md) | The HTTP binding a runtime exposes: `/v1/evaluate`, `/v1/ingest`, enrollment, heartbeat, config, approvals | OTLP/HTTP |

Risk categories live in the [taxonomy](specification/taxonomy.md) (`safety.*` and
`security.*`), versioned and swappable — the contract references category IDs but
stays neutral on what is "unsafe."

## Two domains, one contract

- **Safety** — harmful *content/behavior* (toxicity, self-harm, CSAM, brand,
  topic). Mostly classifier-judged at the content I/O boundary.
- **Security** — *system compromise* (prompt injection, data exfiltration,
  malicious commands, SSRF, secret leakage, sandbox escape, supply chain).
  Mostly policy + provenance, enforceable down to the sandbox kernel.

The contract is unified; the pipelines and enforcement points differ. Start with
the [overview](specification/overview.md).

## Conformance & benchmark

- A detector is **OGR-conformant** if it accepts a `GuardEvent` and returns a
  valid `Verdict` against the [JSON Schemas](schema/). See [CONFORMANCE.md](CONFORMANCE.md).
- The [benchmark](benchmarks/) evaluates conformant detectors on shared corpora
  and publishes the leaderboard.

| [`packages/python/`](packages/python/) | `openguardrails` — the Python SDK: in-process runtime + `RuntimeClient` for the Runtime API (PyPI). |
| [`packages/javascript/`](packages/javascript/) | `@openguardrails/core` — the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK: in-process runtime + `RuntimeClient` (npm). |
| [`integrations/`](integrations/) | Agent, gateway, sandbox, and eBPF integration categories. |

| [`skills/openguardrails/`](skills/openguardrails/) | Agent skill for drafting and enforcing policies. |
| — | [openguardrails.com](https://openguardrails.com) lives in a separate repository; this repo holds the protocol, SDKs, and plugins it documents. |

Packages remain independently versioned and published. The monorepo only
centralizes source, issues, pull requests, CI, and cross-component changes.
See [MONOREPO.md](MONOREPO.md) for the former-repository mapping and rollout
checklist, and [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for npm/PyPI release tags.

### SDKs and plugins

The Python and JavaScript packages implement the same OGR contract — each is
the SDK for its language, and every plugin depends on it:

- Python plugins depend on `openguardrails`.
- JavaScript/TypeScript plugins depend on `@openguardrails/core`.
- End users normally install only the plugin; pip or npm installs its SDK
  dependency automatically. Self-contained marketplace plugins may bundle the
  SDK so they can run without a separate install step.

| **eBPF** | OGR reference sensor (kernel process · filesystem · network events) | [`integrations/ebpf/sensor`](integrations/ebpf/sensor/) |

## Development

The JavaScript packages use npm workspaces:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

The Python packages form a uv workspace and can also be installed with pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install pytest
python -m pip install -e packages/python -e integrations/gateway/openai-anthropic \
  -e integrations/agent/hermes -e integrations/agent/langgraph \
  -e integrations/ebpf/sensor
python -m pytest
```

## Principles

1. **Neutral.** The protocol is open and foundation-governed; the benchmark is a
   referee, not a contestant.
2. **Standardize the boundary, not the brains.** Detection stays competitive.
3. **Provenance-first.** The dangerous thing is usually untrusted input causing a
   privileged action — so trust labels are a core field, not an add-on.
4. **Defense in depth.** Gateway, agent hook, and sandbox observe one action,
   correlated by `guard_id`.

## Status

Current protocol version: **v0.5** (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for
protocol versions). Minor versions before v1 may still break between releases;
each break is logged. See
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for how the spec evolves. Contributions welcome —
