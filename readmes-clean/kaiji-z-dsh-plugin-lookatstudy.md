# dsh-plugin-lookatstudy

Turn any markdown document, local folder, or GitHub learning repository into a guided course inside [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh) — your dsh agent becomes a full AI tutor with the interaction design of [LookatStudy](https://github.com/Kaiji-Z/LookatStudy): per-concept knowledge tracking, mastery-driven progression, spaced repetition, mastery proposals, friction awareness, learner memory, a Cornell notebook, and an in-chat proposal card. Learning engine modules are vendored from LookatStudy (MIT).

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin add dsh-plugin-lookatstudy        # from npm
# or from a tarball:
dsh plugin add ./dsh-plugin-lookatstudy-0.2.1.tgz
```

Works with any profile. In the `web` profile the plugin additionally serves the study tab's HTTP API and loads its browser half; headless profiles get the plain tool surface.

## The two surfaces

**1. The tutor (chat).** Talk to the agent: *"import https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners and teach me lesson 1"*, *"what reviews are due today?"*. The tutor persona (stable core + one of three souls — `guide` 引导 / `direct` 精讲 / `practice` 实战) drives the full LookatStudy loop:

- **Knowledge components (KC)** — on first teaching a lesson the tutor derives 2–7 concepts (`study_define_concepts`); every graded answer is attributed (`study_record_answer` with `concept`); per-concept BKT runs and **lesson mastery is the weakest concept** — quizzes target ⚡weak ones first.
- **Mastery-driven progression** — ≥50% unlocks the next lesson early; ≥90% graduates and schedules the first SM-2 review; answers also nudge the review schedule.
- **Mastery proposals (propose → apply)** — at ≥85% plus a convincing Feynman-style explanation the tutor proposes early graduation and **waits for the learner's yes/no**; only the explicit decision applies it.
- **Friction awareness** — confusion/blocks/frustration are silently logged (`study_report_friction`) and surface as ⚡😣 weak spots.
- **Learner memory** — three slots (global style / per-course pattern / per-lesson gap), read-merge-write (`study_remember`).
- A dynamic **learner snapshot** (focus, strategy band, weak concepts, friction, memory, due count, pending proposal) is injected as runtime context every turn.

**2. The study tab (`dsh.client`).** The whole plugin lives in ONE conversation view tab — 「学习」 — a simplified LookatStudy in three columns, styled entirely with dsh's `--dsw-*` tokens; nothing outside the tab modifies dsh chrome:

### Column · What you get
- **Column**: 左 · 课程 · **What you get**: Course picker, progress, due box with one-click review kickoff, lesson tree (gating, mastery bars, ⚡😣 weak spots, clickable focus), one-click demo import when empty
- **Column**: 中 · 老师 · **What you get**: A read-only mini transcript of the live tutor conversation (assistant replies rendered through the plugin's markdown pipeline, tool calls as chips, streaming included) plus the soul pills (直讲/引导/实战), the focus lesson's starters, and the mastery-proposal banner (接受/再练练). Typing happens in dsh's own composer below the tab — the plugin never ships its own input; every button lands its text in that native composer and submits through the same path as the Send button
- **Column**: 右 · 黑板 · **What you get**: The focus lesson's 讲解 (server-sanitized markdown) and the Cornell 笔记 three zones

The tutor column is a learning surface, not a generic chat: the tutor's quiz options (A–D) render as clickable answer buttons under the latest reply (clicking sends the answer through the native composer), graded answers show as ✓/✗ chips with the tested concept, and every course-tree glyph, tag, and mastery bar carries a hover tooltip explaining its meaning. All content text runs at the dsh chat transcript's own 16 px.

All study state comes from one shared 3 s poll over `/lookatstudy/api/state`; input is dsh's native composer from the first turn (no activation step). Columns stack below 1024 px.

## Tool surface (19)

Import: `study_import_markdown` / `study_import_folder` (9 doc + 30+ code formats; PDF/PPTX unsupported) / `study_import_github` (jsDelivr CDN, works where github.com is unreachable)
Learn: `study_courses`, `study_map`, `study_lesson`
Progress: `study_define_concepts`, `study_record_answer`, `study_complete_lesson`
Proposals: `study_propose_mastery`, `study_resolve_proposal`
Reviews: `study_due_reviews`, `study_record_review`
Awareness: `study_report_friction`, `study_remember`, `study_notes`, `study_note_save`
Misc: `study_set_mode`, `study_delete_course`

## Configuration (cordis.yml patch layer)

```yaml
- id: lookatstudy
  name: dsh-plugin-lookatstudy
  config:
    mode: guide          # direct | guide | practice — initial soul; persists in state afterwards
    statePath: ''        # default: $DSH_HOME/lookatstudy-plugin/state.json
```

## What is intentionally not restored

LookatStudy's Electron-native experiences have no host surface in dsh: persistent text highlighting with DOM anchors, celebration particles, streak/XP gamification (its effect depends on that UI), exam mode, and multimodal lesson images. Everything else — engine, contracts, data models — is ported.

## Development

```sh
pnpm exec tsdown        # build lib/ (host + client entries, peers external)
pnpm test               # 48 node:test cases over the real source (no key needed)

# iterate against a live dsh (this repo lives beside a deepseek-harness checkout):
pnpm dsh web --patch ../dsh-plugin-lookatstudy/cordis.dev.yml   # run from the harness checkout
# then open http://127.0.0.1:3080/ and switch to the 学习 tab
```

Layout: persona + snapshot context in `src/index.ts`, tools in `src/tools.ts`, state transitions in `src/state.ts`, the study tab's HTTP API in `src/dashboard.ts`, sanitized markdown in `src/markdown.ts` (shared by the host routes and the client bundle), the browser half in `src/client/` (`index.ts` tab registration, `views.tsx` the three-column tab plus the pure `transcriptRows` fold, `data.ts` shared poll store, `styles.ts` injected `--dsw-*` stylesheet), UI card projections in `src/cards.ts`, vendored zero-dependency engine in `src/vendor/` (see each file's provenance header; the one local modification to the folder scanner's dedup key is documented there).

Publishing note: `exports` must keep `"./package.json": "./package.json"` — the web bundle's client-module scanner resolves it to discover the `dsh.client` browser half. When re-installing a rebuilt tarball into a profile, remove the old one first or bump the version (pnpm reuses same-spec tarballs).
