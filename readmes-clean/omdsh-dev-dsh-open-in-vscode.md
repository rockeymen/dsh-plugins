# dsh-open-in-vscode

Open a workspace directory in VS Code straight from the DeepSeek Harness web
GUI: every real Workspace row in the sidebar gains an **Open in VSCode** row
inside its **…** overflow menu.

## What it does

- The client half uses the harness's `sidebar.workspaces.row-menu` slot when
  available and falls back to a scoped compatibility adapter on the public
  DSH `0.1.0-rc.6` build. Both paths render the same locale-following menu row
  — **在 VSCode 中打开** under the Chinese locale, **Open in VSCode** under
  English.
- The row's click closes the menu and calls the host over the strict Typert
  Remote `openInVscode/open`, passing the workspace directory.
- The host half spawns the configured editor CLI on that directory
  (`code ` by default), detached, so the editor outlives the server.

## Prerequisites

- VS Code, or an editor CLI on PATH. On Windows, the default `code` command
  also discovers standard per-user and system VS Code installations. On macOS,
  install the
  [VS Code shell command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line)
  or set the plugin `command` to any editor that opens a directory).
- DSH `0.1.0-rc.6` or newer. The plugin uses the native Workspace row-menu
  extension point where present and a compatibility adapter on `rc.6`.

## Install

Add the plugin to your web profile (this runs pnpm inside the profile and
reconciles the bundle layer):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-open-in-vscode/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.5.tar.gz
```

Restart the web server (`kill -TERM ` and wait for exit — never
`kill -9`, it tears the session zstd log mid-frame), then refresh the page.
The host plugin mounts under `dsh-open-in-vscode`; the client bundle is
served at `/plugins/dsh-open-in-vscode/client.js`.

The versioned tarball replaces older pinned commits without running a git
`prepare` script. Confirm the installed version with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web list dsh-open-in-vscode --depth 0
```

## Configuration

Deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields, changeable from
cordis.yml:

### Key · Default · Meaning
- **Key**: `command` · **Default**: `code` · **Meaning**: Executable that opens a directory. The default also probes standard Windows VS Code install locations; other commands resolve through PATH.
- **Key**: `args` · **Default**: `[]` · **Meaning**: Extra arguments passed before the directory path.

A missing executable fails loud with a fix hint; relative paths are refused.

## Capability boundary

### Action · Runs where · Requires approval
- **Action**: Open a workspace directory in the editor · **Runs where**: Host (user gesture) · **Requires approval**: No — the user clicked the row
- **Action**: Anything else · **Runs where**: — · **Requires approval**: The plugin has no tools, no settings namespace, and no model-facing surface

The plugin adds no tools, no skills, and no settings; it only opens the
directory the user already opened in DSH. It never reads or writes files
itself.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check   # typecheck + lint + test + build; commit lib/ (file: installs run without a build)
```

Layout: the wire contract lives in one module (`src/contract.ts`) shared by
the host manifest (`src/typert.ts`) and the client contribution
(`src/client/remote.ts`); the harness owns the slot declaration and the
Menu node-entry kind this plugin composes through.
