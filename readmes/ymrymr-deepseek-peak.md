# deepseek-peak

A drop-in dsh-plugin for the
[`deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)
web UI that shows the DeepSeek V4 API's current peak / off-peak pricing
state, lets you pause the LLM during peak hours with a queue that drains
on its own, watches your account balance, and warns you when the
balance drops below a threshold you set.

![Peak-hours plugin showing the PEAK pill with the queue and the
balance card expanded underneath](./docs/pill-preview.png)

*The PEAK pill in the session header, the BALANCE row with the
REFRESH and TOP UP actions, and the per-model 30-day peak/off-peak
bar charts (v4-pro and v4-flash). The pill is amber when the
balance drops below the configured `lowBalanceWarningUsd`
threshold.*

## What it does

- **Pill** (always visible, in the session header next to the Session
  log button). Reads the current phase from the browser clock against a
  baked-in UTC schedule:
  - Green during off-peak windows
  - Red during peak windows (2× the off-peak rate)
  - A `PRE-CUTOVER` badge while the new schedule is being previewed
  - A live countdown to the next phase boundary
  - A `→ live` target arrow while pre-cutover, or a `→ next phase HH:MM`
    arrow after the cutover
  - A pause toggle at the right edge of the pill: when on AND the phase
    is peak, the LLM stream is gated and user messages queue instead of
    running
  - **Amber border + dot + label when the account balance drops below
    the configured `lowBalanceWarningUsd` threshold** (default $1.00).
    Overrides the phase color so a low balance is visible at a glance.

- **Tooltip** (on hover, while the pill is open). Expands under the
  pill:
  - A **BALANCE** row showing the current DeepSeek account balance
    (host-routed through `/api/peak-hours/balance` so the API key never
    leaves the harness process). Two action pills on the right:
    - **REFRESH** — bypasses the 5-min host cache AND the browser cache
      so a user who just topped up sees the new number without waiting
      for the natural refresh tick.
    - **TOP UP** — opens `https://platform.deepseek.com/top_up` in a
      new tab.
  - A per-model chart card for each model the user has run in the
    trailing 30 days (v4-pro, v4-flash). Each card has a tiny inline
    SVG daily bar chart, 30 days wide, with peak (red) on top of
    off-peak (green). The split is computed from each event's UTC
    timestamp against the schedule.
  - A small legend so the peak/off-peak split is legible without a
    tooltip.
  - When the LLM is gated and the queue has items, a **queue card**
    appears under the chart with one row per queued message and a
    per-row **send arrow** that dispatches that single message
    immediately (bypasses the global pause).

- **Settings** (registered on the existing `peak-hours` namespace in
  the host's settings plane, exposed through `Settings → Plugins →
  Plugin configuration → Peak hours`):
  - `paused` — boolean, the same value the pill toggle writes. Two
    write paths into the same field; last write wins.
  - `lowBalanceWarningUsd` — number, the threshold below which the
    pill switches to amber. Default `$1.00`. Zero is allowed (always
    warn); negatives are rejected by the schema.

- **Background refresh**:
  - The state poll runs every 2 s on the browser (Pill's `usePeakHoursState`
    hook), so toggle / threshold / queue / balance changes propagate
    in under two ticks.
  - The balance is fetched server-side and cached for 5 min, with a
    30-s fast retry on transient errors so a brief blip doesn't poison
    the cache.
  - The chart's per-day buckets come from the host's
    `/api/peak-hours/usage` route, which walks the session persistence
    log. The in-browser trajectory walk is a fallback for the
    harness-not-running case.

> Source of truth: [`api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing/`](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing/).
> The schedule windows and the cutover date are baked in as constants
> in `src/client/domain.ts`. The `PRE-CUTOVER` window is the period
> between "the new schedule is announced" and "the new schedule is
> enforced"; the pill shows it for the duration and the gate is
> engaged whenever `paused && peak` regardless of cutover state.

This repo ships two things:

1. **`harness-plugin/`** — a `dsh-plugin` Cordis client package for the
   harness web UI. This is the real integration.

2. **`widget.html`** + **`serve.js`** — a self-contained browser widget
   you can pin as a tab in any browser, no harness required. Useful as a
   fallback for users who don't run the harness. It does NOT include the
   pause / queue / balance features; it's a phase + countdown display
   only.

The harness plugin is the rich one. The standalone widget is a
"schedule on a second monitor" display.

## Install (harness plugin)

Requires:
- A checked-out `deepseek-harness` working tree (any recent commit)
- `node` ≥ 22.19
- `pnpm` ≥ 11 (install once with `npm i -g pnpm`)

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/YMRYMR/deepseek-peak.git
cd deepseek-peak

# One-liner installer: takes your harness clone as the argument
./install.sh /path/to/deepseek-harness
```

What the installer does (each step is idempotent and skipped if already done):

1. Copies `harness-plugin/` → `<harness>/packages/client/ui-peak-hours/`
2. Adds the `ui-peak-hours` row to `packages/bundle/web-app/cordis.patch.yml`
3. Adds the workspace dep to `packages/bundle/web-app/package.json`
4. Adds the project reference to `tsconfig.client.json`
5. Adds the path mapping to `tsconfig.base.json`
6. Runs `pnpm install` in the harness
7. Runs `pnpm run build:lib:host` (required for the generated Typert contracts)
8. Runs `pnpm --filter @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-peak-hours run bundle`
9. Runs the harness verification gates (warnings only)

Then start the harness:
```sh
cd /path/to/deepseek-harness
pnpm dsh web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080/`. The pill appears in the top-right of the
session header, **left of the Session log button**.

Hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) the first time so the new
`__DSH_BOOT__` roster loads.

### What you should see

A compact pill, ~180 px wide, with this shape (left to right):

```
[●] PEAK PRE-CUTOVER  08h 11m  →  live   [pause-switch]
```

- `[●]` is the colored dot — green for off-peak, red for peak, **amber
  when the balance is below the configured threshold** (overrides the
  phase color)
- The phase label and the `PRE-CUTOVER` badge (only during the
  pre-cutover window)
- The countdown to the next phase boundary (1 Hz tick)
- The target arrow: `→ live` while pre-cutover, `→ next phase HH:MM`
  after the cutover
- The pause switch at the right edge (red when on, gray when off)

### Hover the pill

The card expands under the pill:

- **BALANCE** row — your DeepSeek account balance, with the **REFRESH**
  and **TOP UP** actions on the right
- **Per-model chart card** for each model you've used in the trailing
  30 days (typically v4-pro and v4-flash). Tiny inline-SVG daily bar
  chart, 30 days wide, peak (red) on top of off-peak (green). Day totals
  shown in the top-right of each card.
- A small **legend** under the chart: red = peak, green = off-peak
- If the queue has items, a **queue card** with one row per queued
  message and a per-row send arrow for manual dispatch

### Pause-during-peak workflow

1. Click the pill's pause switch to the right of the countdown.
2. While the switch is on AND the phase is peak, the next LLM stream
   (user message or subagent tool call) is gated. The harness shows
   the request as queued, and the tooltip expands to show the queue
   card.
3. The queue is FIFO. Each item is dispatched the moment the switch
   flips off or the phase leaves peak.
4. To dispatch a single item without flipping the global pause, click
   the row's per-row **send arrow** in the queue card.

### Low-balance warning

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → Peak hours** and set
`lowBalanceWarningUsd` to your preferred floor (default `1.00`). The
pill switches to amber the moment the live account balance drops below
the value. Override the same field directly in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
peak-hours:
  paused: false
  lowBalanceWarningUsd: 1.5
```

The next 2 s state poll picks up the new value automatically.

### Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh /path/to/deepseek-harness
```

The script removes the plugin directory and prints the four small
wire-up entries you need to delete by hand (one line each in
`cordis.patch.yml`, `package.json`, and the two tsconfig files).

## Install (standalone widget)

No harness needed. Just a Node server that serves a static HTML page.

```sh
cd deepseek-peak
node serve.js
```

Opens `http://127.0.0.1:3737/` in your default browser. Pin the tab.
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop.

The standalone widget includes a 24-hour timeline of peak windows, a
V4-Flash / V4-Pro model selector, and the actual $/1M-token rate for
each tier. Useful on a screen that doesn't have the harness open.
Pause / queue / balance features are NOT in the standalone widget —
they live in the harness plugin only.

## Why a plugin AND a standalone

The harness pill is the right answer inside the harness. The standalone
is the right answer everywhere else (a second monitor, a tablet, a
phone browser). Both compute the same numbers from the same
authoritative schedule, so they never disagree.

## Host routes exposed by the plugin

| Route | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/peak-hours/state` | `GET` | Current pause / phase / queue / balance / threshold (2 s polled by the browser) |
| `/api/peak-hours/state` | `POST` | Toggle the global pause (writes through the host's settings service) |
| `/api/peak-hours/balance` | `GET` | Live DeepSeek account balance (5 min host cache) |
| `/api/peak-hours/balance?fresh=1` | `GET` | Force a fresh upstream fetch (bypasses both the host and the browser cache; the in-tooltip REFRESH button calls this) |
| `/api/peak-hours/usage?rangeDays=N` | `GET` | Per-day, per-model token / cost buckets for the trailing N days (default 30, max 365; 5 min host cache) |
| `/api/peak-hours/usage?fresh=1&rangeDays=N` | `GET` | Force a fresh host walk of the session persistence log |
| `/api/peak-hours/queue/dispatch` | `POST` | Manually dispatch the front queued item (the per-row send arrow in the queue card calls this) |

The API key is held by the host's credentials seam and never reaches
the browser — the host routes read the key, fetch from
`api.deepseek.com`, and return the parsed JSON envelope.

## Verified

The plugin passes every harness gate I could run on a Windows dev tree:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm run constraints` | 220/220 packages conform |
| `pnpm run verify-cordis-config` | 120/120 config files passed |
| `pnpm run verify-package-invariants` | 220/220 hand-owned companions conform |
| `tsc -b tsconfig.client.json` | clean |
| `pnpm --filter ... run bundle` | ~78 kB `client.js` |
| `pnpm run build` (host + client + web) | clean |
| Live runtime smoke (curl `/plugins/.../client.js`) | 200, ~78 kB, slot registered |

## Notes

- The schedule and the pre-cutover date are baked in as constants in
  `src/client/domain.ts`. If DeepSeek changes the windows or the
  cutover date, edit the constants there and re-bundle.
- All times are computed in UTC; only the display is localized to
  the browser's IANA zone.
- The pill trusts the browser clock against the baked-in UTC
  schedule. A user with a mis-set system clock will see a misleading
  status. A future iteration can sanity-check via
  `worldtimeapi.org`.
- The pause toggle on the pill and the `paused` field in the
  Plugin configuration page are two write paths into the same
  persisted setting. The 2 s state poll reconciles whichever wrote
  last.
- The pill's REFRESH button invalidates the browser cache (so a
  rapid second click still reaches the host) and calls the host with
  `?fresh=1` (so the host bypasses its own 5 min cache and re-fetches
  from `api.deepseek.com`). Both must be running the latest code for
  REFRESH to work end-to-end; the host change requires a dsh web
  restart.
