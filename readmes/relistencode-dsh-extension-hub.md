Manage DeepSeek Harness (DSH) skills and MCP servers from one place.

Skills management · MCP servers · Skill import · Plugin management · Plugin market

A service-oriented extension center for DeepSeek Harness: a zero-dependency persistence core and CLI, plus a durable settings-page UI embedded in DSH Web — create / edit / enable / disable skills and MCP servers, one-click import from Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, and a full plugin manager (official vs third-party, enable / disable / uninstall, check & update, plus a Plugin Market with a curated store and GitHub search).

🌏 [中文](README.zh.md) · English

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: DSH installed and running (`dsh web` works), Node.js ≥ 22, pnpm ≥ 10.

macOS / Linux (Windows with Git Bash or WSL works too):

```bash
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
pnpm add dsh-extension-hub
grep -q "name: dsh-extension-hub" cordis.patch.yml || cat >> cordis.patch.yml <<'EOF'

- insert:
    - id: extension-hub
      name: dsh-extension-hub
EOF
```

Windows (PowerShell 5.1+ / pwsh):

```powershell
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\web"
pnpm add dsh-extension-hub
if (-not (Select-String -Path cordis.patch.yml -Pattern 'name: dsh-extension-hub' -Quiet)) {
  Add-Content -Path cordis.patch.yml -Value "`n- insert:`n    - id: extension-hub`n      name: dsh-extension-hub"
}
```

Restart `dsh web`, then open **Settings → Extension Management**.

Install once — use the header's **Check Updates** button to upgrade later.

**Built-in skills are read-only**: the list also shows skills bundled with the
deployment (shipped presets, e.g. the `cordis` preset's skills) and skills
shipped inside user presets, marked "Built-in/Preset" and not editable /
deletable / toggleable — they belong to the deployment or preset layer. To
override, create a same-name skill in the user or project directory.

## Plugin Management Guide

The **Extension Management** page ships a full plugin manager since v0.2.0,
with four tabs: **Skills / MCP Servers / Plugins / Plugin Market**.

![Extension Hub overview](docs/screenshots/feature-overview.png)

### Managing installed plugins

The **Plugins** tab lists every plugin row in your DSH composition, split into
two collapsible groups:

- **Official Plugins** — DeepSeek's own `@deepseek-ai/*` packages (collapsed by
  default). They can be disabled but not uninstalled; the `cordis:include`
  entry is the composition loader itself and is marked **Core** — it cannot be
  disabled or removed.
- **Other Plugins** — third-party and your own plugins (e.g. this one).

Click a plugin to see its details: description, source, repository link, entry
id and module name. From the detail block you can:

- **Enable / Disable** — written to your profile `cordis.patch.yml`; takes
  effect after a `dsh web` restart. Disabling warns you that an unknown plugin
  may cause serious problems.
- **Uninstall** (non-official only) — removes the plugin row from the
  configuration, with a warning plus a second "Confirm uninstall?" step. If the
  plugin was installed via a GitHub clone, its local clone directory is deleted
  too.

The **Other Plugins** group header has **Check Updates**: it compares npm
packages against the registry and local git clones against their origin HEAD.
Updateable plugins get a green **Update Available** button next to their status
label — click it to pull the new version (npm tarball or `git pull`), or use
**Update All** to update every updateable plugin at once.

### Discovering & installing new plugins

The **Plugin Market** tab has two sub-views:

- **Curated** (default) — a community-curated catalog
  ([awesome-dsh-plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/plugins.json), refreshed
  daily) with 11 categories, bilingual descriptions, star counts and ordering
  (Featured / Top / Newest). Entries with an npm mapping install **from npm** in
  seconds (registry tarball, with an anti-squatting check that the package
  points back at the listed repository); entries without one fall back to a
  GitHub clone. A 24h local cache keeps the view usable offline.
- **Discover More** — searches GitHub for repositories tagged `dsh-plugin` (a
  free-text query narrows the search). Each result shows stars and an
  "Installed" badge when the repo is already present locally.

Click a curated/discovered entry to open its detail page — description, stars,
category (curated), install method and a link to the repository — then hit
**Install**. Extension Hub:

1. Prefers the **npm registry** when the plugin publishes to npm: downloads the
   tarball into the profile `node_modules` without pnpm (no symlink/permission
   requirements) and registers a bundle row.
2. Otherwise **clones** the repository (shallow) into
   `~/.dsh/extension-hub/plugins/<repo>` and verifies it ships a usable
   `package.json` entry.
3. Registers the plugin in your profile `cordis.patch.yml` (managed insert
   block) and self-checks the write.

After a `dsh web` restart the plugin appears in the **Other Plugins** group,
where you can disable or uninstall it (GitHub-clone installs also remove the
clone directory) and keep it updated with **Check Updates** (npm packages
check the registry; local git clones update via `git pull`).

![Installing plugins online](docs/screenshots/install-plugins.png)

> Installing runs third-party code. Only install repositories you trust, and
> check the repository's own README for install instructions — a repo tagged
> `dsh-plugin` may still be a skill, an MCP server, or need a custom setup.

## Recent Updates

<details>
<summary>Recent updates (click to expand)</summary>

- **2026-08** — v0.2.6: new **Add-ons** block in the Plugin Management tab — install / disable / enable / uninstall companion features (dsh-myrules) without leaving the page; the header **Check Updates** now checks the main plugin AND installed add-ons together and updates everything at once; collapsible block; feature i18n keys aligned with their ids; "Integrate with Extension Hub" invitation section added to both READMEs.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.5: new companion plugin **dsh-myrules** (`packages/dsh-myrules`) — a **Customize (个性化)** page in Settings that edits the host-wide global instructions (`$DSH_HOME/AGENTS.md`, injected into every session, new sessions apply immediately); theme-inverted primary buttons across the plugin manager, slim save button, percentage budget meter; rolling `.bak` backup removed.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.4: **Plugin Market with a Curated store + npm install path** — the Plugin Market tab now leads with a **Curated** view of the community catalog (awesome-dsh-plugin, 11 categories, bilingual descriptions, Featured/Top/Newest ordering, 24h offline cache) beside **Discover More** (GitHub search); plugins with an npm mapping now install from the npm registry via tarball (no pnpm, anti-squatting repo check) with GitHub clone as fallback; settings tab renamed to **Plugin Market**; curated view no longer hangs on load (client-side method registration); quoted (`@scope`) row ids match in installed detection and uninstall; README overhaul with new screenshots.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.3: fix: patch persistence semantics — 0.2.2's flat-row writer was wrong for patch files (a bare top-level `- id:` row means "override" and silently no-ops; rows must be wrapped in `- insert:`). Reverted all patch writes to the managed insert-block region; the profile patch was rebuilt to the correct format. This restores plugin loading after restart.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.2: unified flat-row patch persistence (CLI and UI write the same loader-compatible format); MCP list reads merged rows (region and flat formats); scalar quoting fix for `@`-prefixed names; uninstall removes discover-installed clone directories.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.1: Discover tab pagination ("Load more", 30 per page), plugin detail as a modal popup, truthful "Installed" badges (verified against the config row, not just the clone dir), install write-back verification, horizontal-overflow fixes.
- **2026-08** — v0.2.0: full plugin manager — official vs third-party grouping (vendor-scope based), core protection for the composition loader, enable / disable / uninstall with confirmations, per-plugin check & update (npm registry + local git clones, Update All), and a GitHub-powered **Discover** tab that clones and installs `dsh-plugin` repositories in one click.
- **2026-08** — v0.1.4: package the v0.1.3 changelog into the published artifact (registry-sync release).
- **2026-08** — v0.1.3: strict Typert descriptors (`./typert`) fix `/api/extensionHub/*` 404 in layouts where the protocol package loads twice; one-click update downloads the npm tarball directly (no pnpm).
- **2026-08** — "Check Updates" button in the header: compares the local package version against the npm registry.
- **2026-08** — Section renamed to **Extension Management** with a header ("Manage plugins, skills and MCP"); import moved from its own tab into the Skills and MCP Servers pages.
- **2026-08** — Full zh/en i18n (83 keys), project folder picker, built-in skill read-only layer.
- Initial release — CLI + durable settings UI + zero-dependency persistence core.

</details>

## How it works

- The host half (`lib/host.js`) is a `TypertRemoteService` gateway exposed
  under the `extensionHub` wire namespace; the browser half mounts its Remote
  contribution and calls the mounted namespace service.
- The browser bundle is declared via `dsh.client.platform: "web"` in
  `package.json`; DSH's client-modules system scans it at boot, injects the
  boot manifest, and serves the bundle over
  `/plugins/dsh-extension-hub/client.js` — **no web bundle rebuild required**.
- All real reads/writes run inside the host process (outside the session file
  sandbox) and share the same `lib/` code as the CLI.

## Data sources (discovery scope)

| Source | Skills | MCP |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude** | `<repo>/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `<repo>/.mcp.json`, `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/.claude.json` |
| **Codex** | `<repo>/.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `~/.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `~/.codex/config.toml`, `<repo>/.codex/config.toml` |

Conversion: Claude/Codex `stdio` servers → DSH `transport: stdio`
(`command`/`args`/`env`); `http`/`sse` → `transport: streamable-http`
(`url`/`headers`). Skill `name`/`description`/`whenToUse` are preserved,
`license`/`allowed-tools` fold into `metadata`.

## Persistence locations

### Skills

- **Project scope** `--scope project` → `<target folder>/.dsh/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **Global scope** `--scope global` → `~/.dsh/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Enable/disable rewrites the `disable-model-invocation` / `user-invocable`
frontmatter flags; removal deletes the file.

### MCP

- **Global** → rows are appended/updated inside the managed region
  (`# >>> dsh-extension-hub` … `# <<< dsh-extension-hub`) of
  `~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml`.
- **Project** → writes a manifest `<target folder>/.dsh/mcp-servers.yaml` and
  generates a dedicated preset
  `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/<slug>-mcp/agent.cordis.yml` (based on the shipped
  `standard` preset). Select that preset in the session roster to activate
  the servers.

## Supported platforms

DSH itself runs on Windows, macOS and Linux; this plugin has no platform
specifics — the CLI works anywhere Node.js runs, and the settings UI follows
the DSH Web host.

## Known limitations

- The YAML/TOML parsers are self-contained **subsets** covering the shapes
  that actually appear in DSH compositions and Codex `config.toml`; anything
  outside them is skipped or reported, never silently corrupted.
- Skill discovery matches DSH `dsh-skill-filesystem`: only
  `<root>/<name>/SKILL.md` and `<root>/<name>.md` are recognized; names must
  be kebab-case.
- Project MCP relies on the "generated preset + manually select the preset"
  mechanism; the tool does not switch presets between sessions for you.
- Project-scope enable/disable toggles apply to the generated preset (whether
  the servers load when that preset is selected); the manifest always keeps
  the full record.
- Global MCP removal/editing only affects manager-managed rows (inside the
  managed region); hand-written patch rows are untouched.
- The curated store is a snapshot of the community registry: it refreshes on
  load with a 24h local cache, so it may trail the live registry by up to a
  day. Plugins that need a build step at install time fall back to a GitHub
  clone instead of the npm tarball path.

## Integrate with Extension Hub

DSH Extension Hub can integrate most plugins, letting users manage and keep
every related feature updated in one place. If you are interested, your plugin
is very welcome here too — together we can grow the DSH plugin ecosystem. Once
integrated, your plugin appears in the Add-ons block of the Plugin Management
tab, where users can install, disable, uninstall, and update it together with
the main plugin.

Thank you for your open-source contribution to the DSH community!
