# dsh-user-experience

> A UX walkthrough plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH): **AI simulates target users to uncover UX problems during development—before they reach production—and provides concrete optimization suggestions.**
>
> Scope: React + TypeScript / React + JavaScript / Vue 3, CSS/layout analysis, and optional browser evidence when the current Harness session can open the application.

🎉 Listed in [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/awesome-dsh-plugin).

Existing automated checks (axe, Lighthouse) can only verify absolute rules — contrast ratio, missing alt text. But UX issues are inherently **relative**: a confirmation dialog before deleting protects an occasional user but wastes the time of an operator who processes hundreds of records a day. Without knowing *who it's for*, a "UX issue" cannot be defined.

This plugin makes **target user personas** a prerequisite for the walkthrough: every finding is anchored to an explicit persona, and no persona means no conclusions. By having AI walk through the product as those users, it surfaces experience problems **during development** and gives concrete, locatable, reviewable optimization suggestions—not post-launch user feedback.

**It is a pipeline, not a CLI.** Edit a front-end file and the walkthrough runs itself — no command to remember, no step-by-step approvals. The report card leads with plain language (which page, what happened, how bad), and folds file paths and rule IDs into a "technical details" block you can copy straight to an AI in one click. Verdicts need no IDs either: click a button, or just say "the second one isn't a problem" or "ignore everything below level three".

## Install in Harness

In DeepSeek Harness, enter:

> Install the UX plugin in DeepSeek Harness: `dsh plugin --profile web add github:DietCokewithSugar/dsh-user-experience`

Or run the command directly:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:DietCokewithSugar/dsh-user-experience
```

Restart DSH or reload the `web` profile after installation. GitHub plugins execute build scripts during installation; read the [security note](#installation) before installing, and pin a trusted commit for production use.

## Screenshots

The walkthrough report explains the observed behavior and user impact in plain language:

Once you confirm that a finding is real, the card provides a task Prompt you can copy to another AI. It describes the observed phenomenon rather than prescribing code changes, tells the AI to inspect the complete project context, and explicitly allows copy changes:

Multi-level evidence appears in the technical details so every visual or interaction conclusion can be reviewed:

The report card and confirmation workflow can use the developer’s language (interface preview with sample data):

## Supported inputs and evidence

| Supported | Parsing engine |
|---|---|
| React + TypeScript (.ts / .tsx) | TypeScript compiler API (TSX) |
| React + JavaScript (.js / .jsx) | Same engine; .js may contain JSX, always parsed as TSX |
| Vue 3 (.vue SFC) | `@vue/compiler-sfc` block splitting + `@vue/compiler-dom` template AST; `<script>` / `<script setup>` blocks reuse the TypeScript engine, with line numbers remapped to the whole .vue file |
| CSS / SCSS / Sass / Less / PostCSS | Conservative spacing, compact-layout, and decorative-content candidates; visual conclusions still require a rendered page |
| Rendered page (optional) | When browser/screenshot tools and a runnable app are available, the agent inspects relevant routes and viewports |
| Persona task simulation (optional) | When the task can be executed in a browser, the agent records the steps and evaluates flow redundancy |

**Explicitly unsupported** (reported as-is, no low-quality guesses): Svelte, Vue 2 (SFC syntax is incompatible with @vue/compiler-sfc), mini-programs (.wxml), etc. See the [current implementation specification](dsh-user-experience-v0.3-spec.md) for evidence, product-type, and language behavior.

- Every finding is marked **`static`**, **`rendered`**, or **`interactive`**. Browser capability is optional: without it the walkthrough continues with static evidence and never pretends to have seen the page
- Layout-density, visual-language, and primary-action findings require rendered evidence; redundant-flow findings require an interactive persona walkthrough
- No automatic code changes: the plugin gives optimization suggestions; after you confirm a finding, it generates an observation-led task Prompt for a coding AI
- This is still evidence-bounded: CSS can identify inspection leads, but actual whitespace, hierarchy, and visual quality are not asserted without a real rendered route

## Features

| Capability | Entry point | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Persona init | `/ux init` | The model generates 1–3 persona drafts from README / package.json / route structure and writes them to `.ux/personas.yml` **after user confirmation**; loads directly when the file already exists, without re-asking |
| Persona context injection | automatic | Injects the active personas and walkthrough protocol into every request for the current project (aligned with the AGENTS.md section-provider pattern) |
| Source and CSS walkthrough | `/ux scan` | Confirms scope first, then walks each persona independently and merges one report; 27 rules based on Nielsen’s heuristics, with model judgment and AST/CSS verification |
| Product-specific focus | automatic | Infers `consumer`, `enterprise`, `ecommerce`, `content`, `finance`, `healthcare`, `developer-tool`, `internal-tool`, or `other` from project docs and the scoped flow, then applies the corresponding UX priorities |
| Multi-level evidence | automatic | `static` for source/CSS, `rendered` for real screenshots/DOM/measurements, and `interactive` for a recorded persona task. Missing browser capability degrades gracefully to static |
| Output language | automatic / config | Uses an explicit `outputLanguage` override first; in `auto`, follows the current user's language when supplied by the agent, then the project's primary README. Report cards and AI handoff Prompts support Chinese and English |
| **Change-triggered walkthrough** | automatic | After you edit a front-end file, the turn wraps up by walking **the whole component / page that file belongs to** — not the changed lines (missing-state issues do not exist in a diff). Reports quietly; speaks up only for level-one / level-two issues |
| Report card | automatic | The first screen is plain language only: `[Level one] Admin page` + one sentence on what happened + what the user runs into. File paths, rule IDs and internal numbering live behind "technical details", which expands to structured YAML you can copy to an AI in one click |
| Finding confirmation loop | card buttons / plain speech | Click Confirmed / Not an issue, or just say "the second one isn't a problem", "those are all right", "ignore everything below level three" — **no ID is ever needed**; verdicts go to the session log and fully restore on replay |
| AI task Prompt after confirmation | card button | Once a user confirms a finding, copy a ready-to-use Prompt that describes the observed behavior, affected scenario, user impact, and acceptance goal. It does **not** prescribe code changes, warns that the plugin saw only part of the codebase, and allows UI copy edits |
| Implicit confirmation | automatic | If a finding disappears in a later walkthrough **and that location was actually re-scanned**, the user fixed it — so the finding was real. Nobody clicks anything, and the signal is harder than a button press |
| Report output | automatic | Markdown sorted by severity (**level one–four on screen; P0–P3 demoted to internal identifiers**), common issues (hit by ≥2 personas) first |
| Glossary | automatic | R-02 term verdicts persist incrementally to `.ux/glossary.yml`; later rounds only compare deltas |

### Three run modes, picked by context

| Mode | Behavior | When it applies |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` | Runs to completion, reports, never interrupts or asks for confirmation | CI / headless; **change-triggered walkthroughs** (the agent started it, so the agent digests it) |
| `review` | Reports, then offers one batch confirmation (tick several, submit together) | A user-initiated `/ux scan` |
| `interactive` | Confirms one finding at a time | Opt in manually when tuning rules |

Resolution order: explicit `--mode=` → `mode` in `.ux/rules.local.yml` → plugin config → context detection.

### The five-state finding machine

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Not judged yet |
| `confirmed_explicit` | The user clicked "Confirmed" |
| `confirmed_implicit` | Gone in a later walkthrough, and that location was genuinely re-scanned |
| `rejected` | The user clicked "Not an issue" |
| `stale` | That location was not scanned this round (or the code was deleted outright) — undecidable |

Both confirmed states count as effective findings in the metrics; `stale` is **excluded from the denominator** — "scanned and found nothing" must be distinguished from "never scanned", or deleting code gets misread as fixing it.

### High-frequency review order

The walkthrough checks common issues first: (1) feedback and system status; (2) forms and flow recovery; (3) information architecture, navigation, and primary actions; then (4) cognitive load, consistency, edge states, basic usability, and performance. This order improves review efficiency; the final report is still sorted by actual severity.

### The 27 rules

| ID | Rule | Verification path |
|---|---|---|
| R-01 | Error message without actionable guidance | model (AST only extracts error-branch copy) |
| R-02 | Inconsistent terminology (conditional: only when the round has no level-one / level-two issues) | model (AST only extracts candidate locations) |
| R-03 | Generic wording for irreversible actions | model |
| R-04 | Irreversible action without a confirmation step | model+ast |
| R-05 | Loading state without empty state | model+ast |
| R-06 | Success state without error state | model+ast |
| R-07 | Submit button not disabled while submitting | model+ast |
| R-08 | No fallback for long/overflow content | model+ast |
| R-09 | Dark/light mode adaptation missing | **ast** (fast lane, zero tokens) |
| R-10 | Crowded layout or unclear grouping | source/CSS candidate + **rendered evidence required** |
| R-11 | Long list without pagination, virtualization, folding, or limits | model+ast; static risk can be reported |
| R-12 | Emoji/decorative elements inconsistent with the visual language | source/CSS candidate + **rendered evidence required** |
| R-13 | Page purpose or primary action is unclear | source candidate + **rendered evidence required** |
| R-14 | Redundant steps in a critical task | **interactive persona walkthrough required** |
| R-15 | Navigation categories do not match user tasks | **interactive task-finding walkthrough required** |
| R-16 | Navigation is too deep or lacks location context | **interactive navigation evidence required** |
| R-17 | Long-running operation has no progress feedback | model+ast; static evidence |
| R-18 | Form requests too many or excessive required fields | source candidate + **rendered evidence required** |
| R-19 | Form validation feedback arrives too late | **interactive form task required** |
| R-20 | Form progress is lost when leaving | **interactive leave-and-return task required** |
| R-21 | Flow has no exit, cancel, or undo path | **interactive task required** |
| R-22 | Too many choices without defaults or recommendations | source candidate + **rendered evidence required** |
| R-23 | Equivalent actions differ across pages | **rendered cross-page evidence required** |
| R-24 | Similar components behave inconsistently | **interactive comparison required** |
| R-25 | First-use, offline, or permission states are missing | model+ast; static scoped evidence |
| R-26 | Contrast, font size, or touch targets reduce usability | **rendered measurements required** |
| R-27 | Response time harms a critical task | **interactive timing evidence required** |

Severity is derived from a matrix: `impact` (does it block the persona's critical task; given by the model) × `reach` (share of target users affected; derived from the sum of `share` of hit personas, ≥0.5 is wide) → level one / two / three / four (still P0–P3 internally, never on screen).

### Repository file conventions

| File | Committed to git | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `.ux/personas.yml` | ✅ committed | Project-level consensus, team-shared; CI mode depends on it |
| `.ux/glossary.yml` | ✅ committed | Glossary and verdicts; high reuse value |
| `.ux/rules.local.yml` | ❌ gitignored | Personal walkthrough preferences, not imposed on the team. Supported keys are `mode` and `autoScan`; other keys are tolerated and ignored |
| `.ux/history.jsonl` | ❌ gitignored | Fingerprint ledger: fingerprint, first/last seen, terminal state, and each round's scope. This is **long-term metric data**, not verdicts |

Recommended addition to the project's `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
.ux/rules.local.yml
.ux/history.jsonl
```

Example preference file:

```yaml
# .ux/rules.local.yml
mode: review        # Pin the run mode; omit to pick by context
autoScan:
  enabled: true     # Change-triggered walkthrough switch
  debounceTurns: 1  # Minimum turns between two automatic walkthroughs
```

## Installation

> ⚠️ **Security note (must read)**
>
> Plugins installed from GitHub **run a build script on your machine at install time** (this repo builds its publish artifacts from source via a `prepare` script; on first `add`, pnpm ≥ 10 also asks you to explicitly allowlist that build in your profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). This amounts to **granting the package permission to execute code during installation**, outside the agent sandbox.
>
> Therefore:
> 1. **Only install plugins from sources you trust** — installing is executing;
> 2. **Pin a commit** so later pushes cannot silently change the code that runs at install time:
>
> ```sh
> dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add github:DietCokewithSugar/dsh-user-experience#<commit-sha>
> ```
>
> If you'd rather not grant build permission, install the prebuilt artifact from npm: `dsh plugin add dsh-user-experience`.

### Coexisting with other plugins

Harness, Cordis, and React are **host-owned peer dependencies**. This package does not install or bundle private copies of `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`, `@deepseek-ai/cordis`, other DSH service packages, or React into a profile. All plugins therefore resolve the profile's shared service definitions and Symbol identities.

- No `overrides`, `packageExtensions`, or profile dependency rewrites
- No Node.js or React version changes
- The GitHub `prepare` script only builds this package; it does not run `pnpm/npm install`, `add`, `update`, or `upgrade`
- Compatible DSH release candidates are accepted through peer ranges instead of forcing this plugin's development version into the profile
- CI installs a packed copy into a temporary profile and verifies that the profile and plugin resolve identical real paths for Harness, Cordis, and React packages

This prevents **this plugin** from creating the duplicate-runtime condition. A different plugin that ships DSH packages as direct dependencies can still introduce its own conflicting copy and should adopt the same peer-dependency contract.

After installation, the plugin row (id `ux-experience`) enters the configuration layer; restart `dsh` or reload the profile to take effect. Available config options (overridden by id in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` or the `--patch` layer):

```yaml
- id: ux-experience
  config:
    maxScanFiles: 300            # Max files collected per scan
    maxCandidatesPerRule: 5      # Max candidates per rule per file
    maxCandidatesPerFile: 25     # Total candidate cap per file
    maxFindings: 30              # Max findings per report
    excludePatterns: ['test', 'stories']   # Extra dirs to skip (on top of defaults)
    mode: detect                 # detect|auto|review|interactive (default: pick by context)
    autoScan: true               # Change-triggered walkthrough (on by default)
    autoScanEditTools: ['write', 'edit']   # Tool names counted as "file edits"
    autoScanMaxFiles: 20         # Max changed files pulled into one automatic walkthrough
    autoScanDebounceTurns: 1     # Minimum turns between two automatic walkthroughs
    outputLanguage: auto          # auto|zh-CN|en
```

A user's `.ux/rules.local.yml` takes precedence over this layer.

## Usage

```text
/ux init                                        # Initialize target personas (draft → confirm → write)
/ux scan Order flow from selection to payment   # Start a walkthrough (confirm scope first, then walk per persona)
/ux scan Admin page --mode=auto                 # Pin the run mode (omit it and the mode is picked by context)
```

Once the report is up, **click the card buttons or just talk**:

```text
the second one isn't a problem
those are all right
ignore everything below level three
the delete one — I confirm it
```

After confirming a finding, click **Copy task Prompt for AI** on that card and paste it into your coding agent. The Prompt deliberately describes what users experience without guessing at the implementation from partial source context.

After editing front-end code—including CSS—you need do nothing at all: the static walkthrough runs as the turn wraps up, reports quietly, and speaks up only for level-one / level-two issues. A user-initiated walkthrough can upgrade evidence with browser screenshots and persona task execution when those tools are available.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build     # tsdown (host half + client bundle) + tsc (type declarations)
pnpm test          # smoke tests (AST/CSS / evidence levels / localization / persona / modes / ledger / end-to-end)
pnpm run test:singleton  # pack into a temporary profile and verify shared runtime identities
```

- **Compatibility baseline**: local build/tests use `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*@0.1.0-rc.6` and `@deepseek-ai/cordis@4.0.1`; runtime framework packages are peers resolved from the profile (`>=0.1.0-rc.6 <0.2.0` for DSH).
- Structure: `src/index.ts` is the Host plugin (commands + prompt injection + four model tools + the change-triggered walkthrough); `src/client/` is the Web client plugin (report card, discovered by the module table via the `dsh.client` declaration); one bundle row (`cordis.patch.yml`) mounts both.
- Red line: the agent loop is untouched — all capabilities hang on documented extension points (`ctx.commands` / `ctx.systemPrompt.section()` / `ctx.tools.register()` / `SessionEventMap` / `tools/result` / `agent/turn-stopping`). The automatic walkthrough uses the framework's own `/loop` shape: a listener calls `agent.steer()` at the turn's stop boundary and the machine re-reads its inbox for one more step.
