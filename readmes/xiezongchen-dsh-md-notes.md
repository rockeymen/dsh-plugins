## Overview

A note-taking plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH). It adds an **MD Notes** entry to the web sidebar and a **"Add to note"** action to every assistant answer, so you can capture conversations into plain `.md` files that stay editable anywhere.

**Who it's for**: DSH web users who want local, file-based notes (no database, no cloud) — copy a conversation into a note with one click, then keep editing the `.md` file in any editor.

- **Sidebar notes entry** → notes manager (list + edit/preview)
- **Assistant-message action** (next to the copy button) → append that conversation to a note
- Notes are stored as plain `.md` files, editable directly on the filesystem
- UI copy follows dsh's language setting (Chinese / English)

## Compatibility

- **Plugin version**: 0.2.0 (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for history).
- **Requires**: the `dsh` CLI (with the `plugin` subcommand) and the `web` profile.
- **Last verified**: 2026-08-16, against the deepseek-harness mainline checkout (dsh CLI `0.1.0-rc.x` era).
- The plugin is not pinned to a specific mainline commit; pin the plugin version at install time if you need a fixed combination. Runtime dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/*`, `react`) are declared as optional peer dependencies and resolve from the dsh installation.

## Install / Uninstall

Prerequisites: `dsh` CLI installed, target profile is `web`.

Install from npm (recommended):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-md-notes
```

Then **restart dsh web** (bundle layer and client package metadata are cached in the process; a restart is required for changes to take effect).

Upgrade:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-md-notes
```

A restart of dsh web is required for it to take effect.

Uninstall:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-md-notes
```

> For development/debugging from source: run `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-md-notes`
> from the parent directory of the plugin project.

## Quick start

1. Install the plugin (above), restart dsh web.
2. **Create a note**: click the notes entry at the bottom of the sidebar (above Settings) → enter a title in the "New note title…" field → **New** → type in the editor → **Save**.
3. **Capture a conversation**: below any assistant answer, click the notes icon (next to copy) → pick a target note (or create one on the spot) → **Write to note**. The user question + answer are appended to the note with a timestamped section.

Note files live in the configured local directory (default `<cwd>/.dsh-notes/`); you can open and edit them directly with any editor.

## Configuration

All options are plugin Config keys, overridable in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (a patch replaces the whole `config` of the row):

```yaml
- id: md-notes
  config:
    root: '/abs/path/to/notes'   # notes directory; default <cwd>/.dsh-notes
    route: '/plugins/md-notes'   # HTTP API prefix; default is fine
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `root` | `<cwd>/.dsh-notes` | Directory where notes (`.md` files + `meta.json`) are stored. |
| `route` | `/plugins/md-notes` | HTTP API prefix served by the plugin; also hosts the icon at `<route>/icon.svg`. |

There are **no environment variables and no secrets** in this plugin's configuration.

## Permissions & data

- **Filesystem**: reads and writes notes as plain `.md` files (plus a `meta.json` title/updated-time sidecar) under the configured `root` directory. Nothing else is touched.
- **Network**: a loopback HTTP API (`POST <route>`, browser ↔ local dsh server) and the icon served from the same origin. **No external network calls, no telemetry.**
- **Credentials**: none collected or transmitted.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Changes don't appear after install/upgrade | Restart dsh web — bundle layer and client metadata are cached in the process. |
| Icon looks stale | Hard-refresh the page; the icon is served with `no-cache` and reflects `assets/dsh-md-notes.svg` on every request. |
| Plugin doesn't load | Verify the layer: `dsh --profile web --dump-config` and look for the `md-notes` row. |
| Installed from git and `add` failed | pnpm ≥10 blocks build scripts by default; add the printed package key under `allowBuilds` in the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, then re-run `add`. |
| Notes can't be created/saved | Make sure the configured `root` points to an existing writable directory. |

Rollback: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-md-notes` restores the previous state (notes files are untouched).

## Development

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps   # first time or after dependency changes
npm run link-deps                # link deepseek-harness checkout types (before changing code)
npm run build                    # build lib/index.js + lib/client.js
```

After changing code and building successfully, restart dsh web for it to take effect.

Common scripts:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Full build (tsc host → tsc client → tsdown) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check only (both programs) |
| `npm run link-deps` | Re-link `@deepseek-ai/*` types to the checkout |
| `npm run bundle` | Build only the client bundle |
