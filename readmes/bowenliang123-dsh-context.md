**See what your DeepSeek Harness agent's context window is actually made of and how it evolves.**

`dsh-context` is a [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Harness) plugin that adds a **Context Insight** panel to the web UI: a live, visual answer to *"what is the model carrying right now, and how did it get there?"* — context composition, per-request history, compactions, and injections, all in one place.

## Install

One command, from any DeepSeek Harness installation:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-context
```

Then start the web UI with `dsh web`, open any session, and click the **上下文 / Context** tab. No build step, no restart.

## What you'll see

### 📊 Context stats — the session at a glance

Turns, steps, how much context has been recycled by compactions and prunes, how many injections happened, model switches, and the estimated total tokens sent — next to the provider-reported actuals, so you can see how the estimate holds up.

### 🧱 Current composition — what's in the window right now

A six-color stacked bar scaled against the model's full context window (the gray track is your remaining headroom): system prompt, tool schemas, your messages, injected context, assistant replies, and tool results — plus the top-5 most expensive tool schemas. When a conversation starts degrading, this is where you find out *which part ate the budget*.

### 📈 History — watch the window grow (and get compacted)

One stacked bar per model request, finer than per-message. Toggle between **Turn** and **Step** granularity, scroll sideways through the session, hover any bar for a quick tooltip, and click to pin the full breakdown — including provider-reported actual prompt/output tokens next to the estimate. **✂ marks where compaction or pruning happened** — watch the bars drop:

Above: a real session that grew to ~563k tokens across 48 turns, then compaction (✂) recycled −535.5k in one step, and the conversation continued from a fresh, small window.

In **Step** granularity, hovering any bar shows that single step's context info instantly — its turn/step, timestamp, and estimated vs. provider-reported token counts:

### ⚡ Context events — when and why the window changed

Every compaction, tool-output prune, skill or plugin context injection, and model switch — each with its token delta, turn/step attribution, and timestamp:

### 💬 Messages — the currently model-visible surface

The exact message list the model sees right now, newest first, with a per-message token cost.

## Releasing

Releases are cut by tagging: `git tag vX.Y.Z && gh release create vX.Y.Z`. A [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) then builds, tests, and publishes the package to npm automatically via [npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) — no long-lived token needed, provenance included.
