<p align="center"><strong>Local, layered, supervised memory for DeepSeek Harness—with cross-agent sharing through Mnemon.</strong></p>

`dsh-mnemon` integrates [Mnemon](https://github.com/mnemon-dev/mnemon) with DeepSeek Harness (DSH). It brings hot memory needed every turn, full project Documents, and on-demand long-term Memory Spaces into one workbench. Other agents can share DSH's long-term memory when they also integrate Mnemon and use the same accessible local Mnemon storage.

- **Local first**: memory stays in local SQLite, JSON, and Markdown; no remote memory service is required.
- **Cross-agent sharing**: Mnemon-enabled agents can read and reuse DSH's Mnemon Memory Spaces.
- **Three cooperating tiers**: Runtime Memory, Project Documents, and Memory Spaces retain information at the right granularity.
- **Supervised writes**: isolated memory subagents make semantic decisions; the Host enforces paths, permissions, capacity, locks, and revisions.
- **Native DSH experience**: a Sidebar workbench by default, turn memory, a Save-to-memory dialog, bilingual copy, and global themes.

Current user instructions, repository files, and live tool results always take precedence over historical memory.

## Live demo

![dsh-mnemon Sidebar Memory System and in-conversation interaction demo](./docs/assets/media/dsh-mnemon-memory-system-demo.gif)

See the [Sidebar and conversation UI guide](./docs/en/ui-guide.md) for the complete visual walkthrough.

## Start in five minutes

### 1. Install Mnemon

```sh
# macOS
brew install --cask mnemon-dev/tap/mnemon

# macOS / Linux via Go
go install github.com/mnemon-dev/mnemon@latest

mnemon --version
```

### 2. Install the plugin

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mnemon
dsh --profile web
```

Use an absolute path for a local development checkout:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-mnemon"
```

### 3. Open Memory System

New installations use `sidebar` by default. Click **Memory System** in the DSH sidebar, then follow this first-run path:

1. Confirm the Mnemon CLI, Runtime, Memory Spaces, and Documents are healthy under **Status**.
2. Create a narrowly scoped Memory Space under **Memory Spaces → Overview**.
3. Submit one stable, future-useful item through **Remember**.
4. Verify it with a focused question under **Recall**.
5. Return to the conversation and expand **Turn memory** below the answer.

See [Getting Started](./docs/en/getting-started.md) for provider requirements and complete verification.

## One workbench, three memory tiers

| Tier | Best for | How it reaches context |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | User preferences, collaboration rules, project conventions, environment facts | Compact `USER.md` / `MEMORY.md` projections on every turn |
| **Documents** | Designs, investigations, procedures, postmortems, and handoffs | Deterministic search of active Documents, then full text on demand |
| **Memory Spaces** | Cross-session facts, decisions, entities, and relations | Bounded evidence recalled on demand from active spaces only |

The tiers are not simple copies of the same content. Knowledge is routed by frequency, narrative length, and retrieval needs. See [Storage and the three-tier model](./docs/en/storage-model.md).

### Share long-term memory with other agents

Cross-agent sharing applies to the **Memory Spaces** backed by Mnemon. Another Mnemon-enabled agent can recall from or contribute to the same durable facts, entities, and relations when it targets the same `storageRoot` and Store. DSH-managed Runtime Memory and Project Documents are not automatically exposed to other agents.

The default `global` scope uses `~/.mnemon`, making it the simplest shared memory root for local agents. `custom` and `workspace` roots can also be shared, but every participant must align its directory explicitly. A shared root is shared data: establish a trust boundary first, and avoid incompatible offline migration or directory operations while another process is using it.

## Sidebar workbench

| Page | Main purpose |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Inspect connection, storage root, tier summaries, and Mnemon / dsh-mnemon versions |
| **Runtime** | Inspect USER / MEMORY capacity; filter, add, edit, or remove hot memory |
| **Memory Spaces** | Manage activation; switch among Overview, Recall, Content, and Entities; open Remember |
| **Documents** | Search, read, create, edit, and archive managed Markdown documents |

Add and edit use consistent dialogs, destructive actions require confirmation, long collections expose filters and progressive loading, and Documents use a dedicated reader.

### Memory inside conversations

| Turn memory | Save to memory |
|---|---|
| [![Expanded Turn memory with exact tool links](./docs/assets/screenshots/conversation-turn-memory.png)](./docs/assets/screenshots/conversation-turn-memory.png) | [![Confirm save to memory dialog](./docs/assets/screenshots/conversation-save-dialog.png)](./docs/assets/screenshots/conversation-save-dialog.png) |

- **Turn memory** summarizes recalls, writes, and Document searches for the turn; expand it to jump to the matching page.
- **Save to memory** loads an editable candidate. Only confirmation sends it to the memory subagent for qualification, deduplication, distillation, and writing.

Both are on by default. Disable them independently under **Settings → Memory System → Conversation interface**; saved changes apply live.

## Display and storage

Configuration lives in `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` (commonly `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`):

```yaml
mnemon:
  displayMode: sidebar # sidebar | buildin; sidebar by default
  storageScope: global # global | workspace | custom
```

| Choice | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `sidebar` | Default dedicated workbench aligned with official DSH panel styling |
| `buildin` | Preserves the original conversation-area presentation and visuals |
| `global` | Shares `~/.mnemon` (or `MNEMON_DATA_DIR`) across workspaces |
| `workspace` | Uses `<workspace>/.mnemon`; the workbench may inspect another workspace while the Agent still follows the current session |
| `custom` | Uses an absolute or `~/...` path supplied through `dataDir` |

Saved settings apply live without a manual refresh. Changing scope never migrates, merges, or deletes old data. If the inspected workspace differs from the session's effective workspace, the header explains the mismatch and offers one-click alignment.

## Common commands

```text
/mnemon status
/mnemon recall <query>
/mnemon related <full memory ID>
/mnemon remember <stable, self-contained durable insight>
/mnemon forget <full memory ID>
```

Recommended lookup order: Runtime Memory → active Documents → active Memory Spaces → archived original referenced by a hit.

## Data and security boundaries

- The plugin reaches durable memory through the local `mnemon` CLI. The WebUI neither reads SQLite directly nor starts processes.
- CLI calls use argument arrays with shell disabled, bounded output, timeouts, and cancellation.
- The plugin stores no API keys. Subagent inference uses the provider already configured in DSH.
- There is no deterministic secret scanner yet. Never store keys, tokens, private keys, or raw sensitive logs in any tier.
- Uninstalling the plugin does not remove data under `~/.mnemon`, workspace `.mnemon` roots, or custom directories.

See [Operations, security, and troubleshooting](./docs/en/operations.md) for complete boundaries, backup, recovery, and diagnostics.
