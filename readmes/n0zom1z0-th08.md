This project aims to reconstruct the source code of the original Japanese
`東方永夜抄 ～ Imperishable Night` version 1.00d executable, with reproducible
binary comparison as the acceptance criterion.

The repository continues the work of
[GensokyoClub/th08](https://github.com/GensokyoClub/th08). Its complete Git
history was imported rather than squashed, preserving the authorship and
contribution record of the original project. New infrastructure and
reconstruction work build on that baseline.

The project remains active reverse-engineering work. Existing source, symbol
mappings, or generated progress artwork must not be interpreted as a new exact
matching percentage without a reproducible report against the target binary.
Current source-presence inventory is generated in
[docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md) and is deliberately labeled separately
from strict exact-match coverage.

## Target executable

Supply your own original executable as `resources/th08.exe`:

| Property | Required value |
| --- | --- |
| Version | Original Japanese 1.00d |
| Size | `840,704` bytes |
| SHA-256 | `330fbdbf58a710829d65277b4f312cfbb38d5448b3df523e79350b879213d924` |
| PE image base | `0x00400000` |
| Entry point | `0x004A619E` |

Localized or patched executables are different binaries and are intentionally
out of scope. The executable and game data are copyrighted assets and are not
included.

```bash
python3 scripts/verify-target.py
```

## Build

Initialize the third-party submodules, then create the upstream Visual Studio
.NET 2002/DirectX 8 environment. On Linux or macOS:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/create_th08_prefix
python3 ./scripts/build.py
```

The prefix helper uses Wine by default; set `WINE` before invoking it when a
different compatible runner is required. On Windows, use the upstream setup
script directly:

```text
python scripts/create_devenv.py scripts/dls scripts/prefix
python scripts/build.py
```

See [Build and exact matching](docs/BUILD_MATCHING.md) for dependency,
build-mode, reccmp, and objdiff details.

## Analysis status

The currently available IDA MCP session is attached to TH07. It must not be
used as TH08 evidence. Until an exact TH08 1.00d IDB is open and the metadata
preflight passes, use target-side `objdump`/`llvm-objdump`, a correctly imported
Ghidra project, and the inherited upstream mappings. See
[IDA and analysis safety](docs/IDA_MCP.md).

## Credits and provenance

This continuation exists because of the reconstruction and tooling work by
the contributors to [GensokyoClub/th08](https://github.com/GensokyoClub/th08).
Their commits retain their original author/committer metadata in this
repository. The upstream project also credits @EstexNT for porting its
`var_order` pragma to MSVC7.

The [N0zoM1z0/th07 reconstruction](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th07) supplies
this repository's workflow, structure, target gates, claims, matching, and
documentation model. [GensokyoClub/th06](https://github.com/GensokyoClub/th06)
is adjacent-engine corroboration only; neither reference overrides TH08 target
evidence.
