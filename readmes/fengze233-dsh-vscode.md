**English** | [中文](README.zh.md)

Use the [DeepSeek Harness (DSH)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) web UI right inside VS Code: click a sidebar icon to embed DSH, which auto-starts (or reuses) the `dsh web` service — code and AI interface side by side, no more switching between terminal, browser, and IDE.

## ✨ Features

- 🖱️ **One-click open**: a DSH whale icon in both the left Activity Bar and the right Secondary Side Bar — click either to embed the DSH page in that sidebar;
- 🚀 **Automatic service management**: auto-detects the port — reuses an already-running `dsh web`, otherwise starts one silently in the background and loads it once ready;
- 🔄 **Live status sync**: four-state status bar indicator (running green / starting yellow / failed red / stopped gray); click it to toggle the panel;
- 🛟 **Error fallbacks**: port occupied, `dsh` missing, start timeout, crash/disconnect — each has a dedicated page with one-click reconnect, never a blank screen;
- 🌐 **Bilingual UI**: copy follows the VS Code display language — Chinese for `zh-*`, English otherwise;
- 🧹 **Clean exit**: closing the window stops the auto-started service, no zombie processes; manually started services are never touched;
- 🔒 **Security boundary**: loopback addresses only (127.0.0.1 / localhost / [::1]); no credentials are read.

## 📥 Installation

**Option 1: Marketplace (recommended)**

Search for `DSH` (publisher Fengze233) in the VS Code Extensions view, or run:

```bash
code --install-extension Fengze233.dsh-vscode-panel
```

Marketplace page: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Fengze233.dsh-vscode-panel>

**Option 2: .vsix package**

1. Download the latest `dsh-vscode.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/Fengze233/dsh-vscode/releases);
2. In VS Code press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → run `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` → select the file;
3. Reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window`).

**Option 3: Build from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fengze233/dsh-vscode.git
cd dsh-vscode
npm install
npm run package        # produces dsh-vscode.vsix, then install as in Option 2
```

**Prerequisite**: the `dsh` CLI from [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) must be installed and on your PATH (the extension detects it and shows a hint if missing).

## 🚀 Usage

1. After installation, a DSH whale icon appears in both the left Activity Bar and the right Secondary Side Bar;
2. Click either icon: the extension auto-starts (or reuses) `dsh web` and embeds the DSH page in that sidebar;
   - Click the **right** icon → the panel opens on the right, leaving the file explorer untouched;
3. Panel title bar buttons: `Open in Browser` `Restart Service` `Stop Service` `Copy URL` `Show Logs`;
4. The bottom status bar shows the service status; click it to toggle the panel.

### Command palette (prefixed `DSH:`)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `DSH: Open Panel` | Open the left panel |
| `DSH: Open in Secondary Side Bar` | Open the right panel |
| `DSH: Open in Browser` | Open the DSH page in the system browser |
| `DSH: Restart Service` | Restart the extension-managed service |
| `DSH: Stop Service` | Stop the extension-started service |
| `DSH: Copy URL` | Copy the DSH page URL |
| `DSH: Show Logs` | Open the extension log output channel |
| `DSH: Retry Bridge Install` | Reinstall the bridge and restart the service |
| `DSH: Uninstall Bridge` | Remove the bridge package and restore `cordis.patch.yml` |

## 🔗 Bridge integration

After installation, the extension installs its own bridge package `dsh-vscode-bridge` into DSH's official client-plugin extension point under your DSH user directory, enabling two integrations:

- 🔗 **External links**: clicking a link in the panel opens it in your system browser (instead of being trapped inside the iframe);
- 📂 **File jumps**: clicking a file path in the panel opens the file in VS Code.

### Install / uninstall mechanism (transparency disclosure)

To let the DSH page communicate with VS Code, the extension will:

1. Install its bridge package `dsh-vscode-bridge` into your DSH user directory (`$DSH_HOME/profiles/web`, default `~/.dsh/profiles/web`) via DSH's official client-plugin extension point;
2. Write a marked `insert:` entry (wrapped in `# dsh-vscode-bridge: begin` / `# dsh-vscode-bridge: end`) into `cordis.patch.yml`, registering the bridge as a DSH client plugin — writing only to the user directory and never touching the DSH installation directory.

To remove: run `DSH: Uninstall Bridge` — the extension deletes the marked entry and the bridge directory, restoring the original `cordis.patch.yml` (your own content is untouched).

### Bridge-related settings (`dsh.*`)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dsh.bridge.enabled` | `true` | Enable the bridge (when off: no install, no injection, no warning; the two integrations are unavailable) |
| `dsh.workspaceRootIndex` | `0` | For multi-root workspaces: which root to use as the `dsh web` process working directory (out-of-range falls back to the first) |
| `dsh.bridge.silenceWarning` | `false` | Suppress the bridge degradation warning |

### Degradation behavior

The bridge only works inside the panel. If it is inactive (e.g. you open the DSH page in a browser, or the install failed), the panel remains **fully usable** — only the two integrations above are unavailable; a one-time startup warning (with "Retry Install" / "Don't Show Again") is shown.

## ⚙️ Settings (`dsh.*`)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dsh.port` | `3080` | Desired port (used for both detection and startup) |
| `dsh.host` | `127.0.0.1` | Service address (loopback only) |
| `dsh.autoStart` | `true` | Auto-start the service when it is not running |
| `dsh.stopOnExit` | `true` | Stop the extension-started service when the last window closes |
| `dsh.extraArgs` | `[]` | Extra arguments appended when starting `dsh web` |

## 🌍 Localization

UI copy follows the VS Code display language (`Configure Display Language`): `zh-*` → Simplified Chinese, anything else → English.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Requirements: Node.js ≥ 22, VS Code ≥ 1.91.

```bash
npm install
npm run test          # 75 unit/integration tests (including a full real dsh web flow)
npm run compile       # builds out/extension.js
npm run watch         # watch build
npm run typecheck     # type check
npm run package       # package .vsix
```

Debugging: open this folder in VS Code and press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host.

## 🧭 Known limitations

- The colored icon on the "Get Started with DSH" walkthrough card comes from Marketplace gallery data and only appears after the extension is published (the card itself works regardless);
- VS Code platform rule: the left icon opens the left panel, the right icon opens the right panel — the left icon cannot open the right panel.
