# News Agent

News Agent is a local, personal news service. It collects RSS feeds, Hacker News, and built-in signal sources into one scored news pool, adds a GitHub Trending digest, and uses an OpenAI-compatible LLM to rank, summarize, and deliver to Feishu or Discord.

It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. A local web console, HTTP API, and stdio MCP server all manage the same configuration and jobs.

## Features

- Aggregate RSS feeds, Hacker News, Product Hunt, Reddit, App Store new apps, V2EX, 36Kr, Sspai, OSChina, Jike topics, and other built-in sources into one news pool, with GitHub Trending generated alongside it.
- Rank, filter, deduplicate, and summarize content with an LLM.
- Add, update, verify, and remove RSS sources from the web console, API, or MCP.
- Set interests, exclusions, source weights, delivery times, and item limits.
- Run scheduled fetches and deliveries, or trigger them manually.
- Deliver to Feishu, Discord, or a custom HTTP endpoint.
- Keep configuration, logs, and job history in the local user-data directory.
- Bind the local control plane to `127.0.0.1:12301` by default.

## Requirements

- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- An API key for an OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, or Anthropic Messages endpoint

The installer scripts for macOS, Linux, and Windows will automatically install `uv` for the current user if it is not already available.

## Install

You can install News Agent using a single terminal command without cloning first:

macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huawolf/news-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huawolf/news-agent/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer creates `.env` from `.env.example`, installs the locked runtime dependencies, registers a per-user login service, and restarts that service so repeated installs immediately run the updated code. Open <http://127.0.0.1:12301> after installation.

## Configure

### Default Client Mode

Regular users run in `client` mode by default. The shared server fetches and
scores the common source catalog once; each client pulls the last 24 hours of
processed entries scoring at least 60 plus the latest successful GitHub digest, adds and scores only
its private custom RSS feeds, then uses its own preferences, schedule, language,
item limit, LLM, and delivery channel to select, summarize, and send the digest.

The default connection is:

```json
"mode_settings": {
  "mode": "client",
  "server_url": "http://13.158.182.33:12301",
  "server_api_token_name": "processednews"
}
```

`processednews` is the shared-news API value and does not protect the local
configuration page. `NEWS_AGENT_LOCAL_TOKEN` is a separate, optional private
password used only by the local Web/configuration API. Never replace one with
the other.

The local page reads `/api/news-sources` under the optional local-control rule.
Remote clients read `/api/server/sources` with `processednews`; these are
separate endpoints so an unset `NEWS_AGENT_LOCAL_TOKEN` never causes the local
page to request shared-news authentication.

Operators running the shared service use `mix` mode. Mix mode performs the
server fetch/scoring work, retains a rolling 24-hour in-memory cache, exposes
the shared-news endpoints, and can also run its own delivery workflow. Manual
and scheduled runs both process the full enabled source set and GitHub; delivery
schedules control only time and final news count.
Configurations without `mode_settings` receive the same regular-user `client`
defaults. Set `standalone` or `mix` explicitly only for self-hosted operation.

Configure the model, endpoint, protocol, API key, and delivery webhooks in the
**Model and delivery settings** section of the local web console. The fields
save automatically and the model connection can be tested in place. Keep the
console private because it displays configured secret values.

Secrets are stored in `.env`. Model settings, preferences, and delivery
schedules are stored in `config.json` through the validated local API. The LLM
key variable in `.env` must match `llm.apiKeyName`; the default configuration
uses `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

```dotenv
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
FEISHU_WEBHOOK_URL=https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/...
# DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

When using another key variable, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` or
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, set `llm.apiKeyName` to the same name through the local API.
After editing `.env` directly, restart the service from the project directory:

```bash
uv run news-agent service restart
```

The first service start creates `config.json` from
[config.json.example](config.json.example). Use the web console or local API to
manage model settings, feeds, preferences, and schedules instead of replacing
the active configuration file.

Optional source integrations can also use `.env` credentials. Product Hunt,
for example, uses `PH_TOKEN` when configured and falls back to its public feed
when the token is absent.

Important settings:

- `preferences`: interests, exclusions, source weights, language preference, and diversity limits.
- `llm`: model, endpoint, API-key environment variable, and protocol. The Web
  console detects OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, or Anthropic
  Messages from the endpoint and model name, allows manual override, and can
  save and test the current connection.
- `sections.signals`: built-in signal adapters for Product Hunt, Reddit fallback, GitHub variants, V2EX, RSSHub topics, App Store regions, and domestic RSS sources.
- `schedule.fetch_lookback_minutes`: fetch lookback window; defaults to 1440 minutes so built-in signals only keep the last 24 hours, except daily ranking pages such as GitHub Trending.
- `log.retention_days`: number of daily log directories to retain; defaults to 30 days.
- `delivery.schedules`: cron schedules and the unified news `max_items` limit per delivery. Every run processes the full news source pool and GitHub; sources are not selected per schedule.
  Without an explicit schedule, deliveries default to 10:00 and 20:00 daily,
  with at most 10 news items each time.
- `delivery.immediate`: high-score alert threshold and daily limit.
- `mode_settings`: selects `standalone`, `mix`, or `client`. Client deployments
  read pre-scored entries with `score >= 60` from `server_url`; mix deployments also expose the
  rolling shared-news API. `server_api_token_name` carries the shared API value
  `processednews`; it is unrelated to `NEWS_AGENT_LOCAL_TOKEN`.
- `push`: enable Feishu, Discord, or a custom endpoint.

## Run

Use `uv run news-agent` for all commands:

```bash
uv sync                         # Install development dependencies
uv run news-agent check         # Check LLM connectivity
uv run news-agent fetch         # Fetch and score once
uv run news-agent push          # Generate and send one digest
uv run news-agent serve         # Run the local web/API service
uv run news-agent mcp           # Run the stdio MCP server
uv run news-agent service status
```

The `serve` command starts the built-in scheduler and the local API at <http://127.0.0.1:12301>. Interactive API documentation is available at <http://127.0.0.1:12301/docs>.

A shared mix server must listen on an interface reachable by its clients, for
example:

```bash
uv run news-agent serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 12301
```

Before exposing a mix server, set a private `NEWS_AGENT_LOCAL_TOKEN` for its
management API. Clients still use `processednews` only for shared-news reads.

To remove the login service without deleting data:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

On Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\uninstall.ps1
```

## Local API and MCP

The local API supports configuration, source, delivery, job, and log operations.
Set `NEWS_AGENT_LOCAL_TOKEN` in `.env` to protect these local management
requests. It is not the shared server value `processednews` and is never used
for client-to-server news retrieval.

The MCP server is intended for a local agent process:

```json
{
  "command": "uv",
  "args": ["run", "news-agent", "mcp"],
  "cwd": "/path/to/news-agent"
}
```

Available MCP tools include source management, preference and schedule updates, manual fetch/push jobs, digest previews, job status, and recent logs. `run_push` requires explicit confirmation.

AI agents performing installation or initial configuration should follow the
[News Agent Operator skill](SKILL.md). It defines the
non-browser workflow for secret handling, API configuration, service restart,
health checks, model testing, previews, and confirmed delivery.

## Data and Logs

Runtime data is stored in the project directory by default:

| Type | Directory |
| --- | --- |
| News data | `news-data/` |
| Logs | `logs/` |
| Job records | `runs/` |

Use `NEWS_AGENT_DATA_DIR` or `NEWS_AGENT_CONFIG` to override these paths. Application logs use rotating files; the project does not depend on system journals.
Mix and standalone servers keep the latest successful GitHub section at
`news-data/github-latest.md`; shared clients read it through
`/api/server/github-trending`.

## Security

News Agent binds to loopback by default. Regular clients should keep that
default. A mix server may expose port `12301` for shared-news clients; protect
its local management routes with `NEWS_AGENT_LOCAL_TOKEN` and restrict network
access where practical. The public `processednews` value is not a management
password. Keep `.env`, webhook URLs, and API keys out of version control.
