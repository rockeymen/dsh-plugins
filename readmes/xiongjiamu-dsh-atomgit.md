# dsh-atomgit

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

AtomGit plugin bundle for DeepSeek Harness (dsh): lets dsh users host and manage code on AtomGit out of the box. One package delivers all three AtomGit services:

| Layer | Source | Shape in dsh |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow | [atomgit-skills](https://gitcode.com/hust-open-atom-club/atomgit-skills) | Six built-in skills in the model's `<available_skills>` catalog, loaded on demand via the `skill` tool |
| Execution | [atomgit-cli](https://gitcode.com/hust-open-atom-club/atomgit-cli) (`ag`) | The model runs `ag` commands directly through the built-in bash tool |
| Interaction | AtomGit platform-hosted MCP server (`https://api.gitcode.com/mcp-server/v1/mcp`) | Native tools `mcp__gitcode__*` bridged by `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` over streamable-http; no local server to run |

Built-in skills (vendored from the atomgit-skills upstream): `atomgit-plan-issues`, `atomgit-implement-issue`, `atomgit-review-pr`, `atomgit-merge-pr`, `atomgit-publish-cli-release`, `atomgit-mirror-to-github`.

## Installation

Prerequisites — **one authentication step covers all three modules**:

```sh
# The only setup needed: install ag and log in once.
# `ag auth login` stores the AtomGit PAT at ~/.config/ag-cli/token.json.
npm install -g @hust-open-atom-club/atomgit-cli
ag auth login
```

That's it. No separate token setup for the MCP endpoint or the skills.

## Authentication (unified)

All three modules share **one AtomGit PAT** — the same credential `ag auth login` obtains (its OAuth token *is* a PAT):

| Module | How it authenticates |
| --- | --- |
| `ag` CLI / skills | Read `~/.config/ag-cli/token.json` directly |
| MCP endpoint (`mcp__gitcode__*`) | The plugin's `atomgitAuth` service resolves the token from the same ag credential file and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <PAT>`; no user setup |

Optional override: to use a different token (e.g. a manually created PAT from GitCode → Settings → Access tokens), set `GITCODE_TOKEN` in the `.env` of the dsh working directory — the plugin falls back to it when the ag credential file is absent.

Install the bundle (run from the directory containing this package):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-atomgit
# or from a remote: dsh plugin --profile web add github:you/dsh-atomgit#<sha>
dsh web
```

## What the model gets

After startup the model side automatically gains:

- Six `atomgit-*` skills in the `<available_skills>` catalog, loaded on demand via the `skill` tool; `references/` files (e.g. `ag-commands.md`) are read on demand through the directory resource hint.
- Native `mcp__gitcode__*` tools (repos / branches / issues / PRs / search) from the AtomGit platform-hosted MCP server — no local server, Docker, or Python install needed.
- `ag` in bash (`ag repo view`, `ag pr list`, `ag issue create`, …).

Typical workflow: `atomgit-plan-issues` to plan issues → `atomgit-implement-issue` to implement and open a PR → `atomgit-review-pr` to review → `atomgit-merge-pr` to merge after your explicit authorization.

## Configuration overrides

A patch replaces a row's whole `config`; users override by row id in their profile `cordis.patch.yml` or a `--patch` overlay:

```yaml
# Disable the MCP server entirely (skills + ag only):
- id: mcp-gitcode
  disabled: true

# Point at a different endpoint (e.g. a self-hosted MCP server):
- id: mcp-gitcode
  inject: [atomgitAuth]
  config:
    serverName: gitcode
    transport: streamable-http
    url: https://your-host/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: !!js '`Bearer ${ctx.atomgitAuth.token ?? ""}`'
```

## Syncing skills

`skills/` is vendored from the atomgit-skills upstream pinned to a tag, keeping "plugin version ↔ skill version" reproducible:

```sh
npm run sync-skills            # sync main
npm run sync-skills -- v1.2.3  # sync a specific tag
```
