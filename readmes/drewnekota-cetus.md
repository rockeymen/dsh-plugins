![Cetus demo — launch an agent, schedule an automation, and switch runtimes](docs/cetus-demo.gif)

## Four things Cetus adds to your agent

### Quick Launcher — your agent, one hotkey away

Hold **both ⌘ keys** to summon your agent over any app. Cetus brings along the current screenshot, frontmost app, browser URL, and selected text as removable context chips, so you can ask in place instead of stopping to explain what you are looking at.

![Cetus quick launcher demo](docs/quick-launcher.gif)

### Automations — let it work while you are away

Turn any prompt into a one-off or recurring job (`at` / `every` / `cron` / `daily`). Each run keeps its chosen runtime and model settings, works in a fresh background conversation, and leaves the result ready for you to review.

![Cetus Automations demo](docs/automation.gif)

### Global Quick Reply — draft the answer without leaving the thread

Double-tap **right ⌥** on any conversation — a team channel, an email, a support console — and Cetus reads what is on screen, then streams a draft into an editable panel. It follows the language and register of the thread and answers what was actually asked, so a message with three open questions does not come back as "sounds good". Press **⏎** to drop it into the input you were already in, or **⇥** to redraft the same screen on another runtime.

![Cetus global quick reply demo](docs/quick-reply.gif)

### Screen Context — let it remember what you were doing

With screen context on, Cetus periodically captures frames, dedupes them, and OCRs them on-device with Apple Vision. Your agent can later recall what was on screen or search the history by text and app. Images and text stay on your Mac; capture is opt-in, with retention controls and an excluded-apps list.

![Cetus screen context settings](docs/screenshot-screen-history.png)

## Get started

The prebuilt app supports **Apple Silicon** and **macOS 13 or later**.

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/drewnekota/cetus/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and move Cetus to Applications.
3. Use the built-in Cetus runtime, or select an already installed and signed-in `claude`, `codex`, or `dsh` (DeepSeek Harness) CLI.
4. Choose a workspace and give the agent its first task.

Claude Code, Codex, and DeepSeek Harness reuse their existing CLI login — there is no second account to configure. Building from source is documented under [Development](#development).

> **Early release:** Cetus is under active development. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/drewnekota/cetus/issues) if something breaks or if a workflow is missing.

## Everything else

### Keep the runtime you already trust

Use the built-in pi runtime, **Claude Code**, **Codex**, or **DeepSeek Harness** with the models, tools, and login you already have. Cetus translates each runtime into the same desktop workflow while preserving conversation context and background terminals across replies.

Pick a **workspace**, choose a runtime, optionally attach files or a screenshot, and send. For parallel coding tasks, enable per-conversation git worktrees so each agent edits an isolated checkout.

![Cetus chat — What should we work on?](docs/screenshot-chat.png)

### Review background work in one place

Every conversation is a card tracked across **In progress · Needs review · Done**. Automations, long-running tasks, and parallel solutions all surface here instead of getting buried in terminal sessions.

![Cetus Kanban board](docs/screenshot-kanban.png)

### More ways to extend your runtime

- **Persistent memory** you and the agent both edit, injected into future turns
- **Parallel solutions**: fan one prompt into N candidate runs, then keep one and archive the rest
- **Per-conversation git worktrees** for isolated coding sessions
- **Visual quick reply** for drafting replies from the current screen without starting a full agent run
- **Cetus Remote**, an optional Tailscale-backed mobile companion for following runs and handling approvals
- **Voice dictation** and **meeting memory**, processed on-device
- **Computer and browser control**, with confirmation before consequential actions
- **30+ model providers**, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Bedrock, Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter

### Dictate from any app

Hold a hotkey from any app and talk — Cetus pops a floating equalizer HUD, transcribes on-device with Seed-ASR, and drops the cleaned-up text wherever your cursor is. The same stack as the in-app mic, but it follows you across the desktop.

![Cetus voice dictation HUD](docs/voice-hud.jpeg)

This photo was taken with a phone because the floating overlay does not show up in screenshots.

### Turn meetings into searchable context

Turn on **meeting memory** and Cetus quietly transcribes your calls into searchable notes — on-device, text only, no audio stored.

- **Auto-detect** — when another app grabs your mic (Zoom, Teams, FaceTime, Feishu…), Cetus starts a session and stops when the call ends. Nothing to press.
- **Manual** — global hotkey (default **⌘⇧M**) for in-person meetings that auto-detect can't pick up.
- **Both sides** — your mic is you; system audio is everyone else, captured separately so the transcript knows who said what (macOS 14.2+; falls back to mic-only below that).

Transcription is 100% on-device via Apple's Speech framework — streaming, punctuated, segmented on natural pauses. While a session is live, a small floating pill (red dot + elapsed timer + stop button) sits at the top of your screen without stealing focus.

Those notes become context the agent can reach: ask "what did we decide about the launch date?" and Cetus searches your meeting history (`search_meeting_history`) — all local, nothing uploaded. Off by default; the master switch means Cetus never listens until you opt in. macOS only for now.

![Cetus meeting memory — Settings → Meetings](docs/screenshot-meetings.png)

### Stay in control

Each capability is opt-in. **Computer & Browser control** lets the agent drive your browser and Mac apps through numbered element lists (not raw pixels), with a confirmation step before anything consequential (sending, deleting, purchasing, submitting, authenticating) and a Stop button always in reach.

![Cetus settings — Computer & Browser control](docs/screenshot-settings.png)

## Why Cetus

General-purpose agents such as Codex, Claude Code, and DeepSeek Harness are already powerful. Cetus does not try to replace them. It gives them the parts of a desktop assistant that do not belong inside a terminal: an always-available entry point, ambient context from your Mac, continuity across sessions, background scheduling, and a place to review completed work.

The runtime remains the intelligence and execution engine. Cetus is the assistant layer around it. Choose the runtime for each task, add only the context you want, and make work that spans hours or days visible and inspectable.

That makes workflows practical that do not fit neatly into a terminal tab:

- Run an agent while you are away and review the result later.
- Compare independent solutions without colliding git changes.
- Carry project decisions and preferences into the next conversation.
- Connect coding work to the meetings, screens, and apps surrounding it.

### Memory and Dreaming

The three factors describe a single moment. What makes an agent useful over time is whether it accumulates anything.

![Cetus — the agent loop](docs/agent-loop.png)

- **Memory** is context the agent writes back to itself — so the next session picks up where the last one left off instead of starting from scratch.
- **Dreaming** runs while you're idle: Cetus reflects on recent conversations and consolidates them into durable notes, turning raw history into preferences that persist. On by default.

## Development

### Requirements

- **Node** ≥ 20, **pnpm**, **bun** (for building the pi sidecar binary)
- **Rust** stable (`rustc`, `cargo`)
- **Tauri** prerequisites: <https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>
- A **`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`** (or your provider of choice; pi auto-picks up `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.)
- **Optional**: the **Claude Code** (`claude`), **Codex** (`codex`), and/or **DeepSeek Harness** (`dsh`) CLIs installed and logged in, if you want them as conversation runtimes — Cetus reuses their existing login, no extra setup

### First-time setup

```bash
pnpm install
# Build pi as a single-file binary into src-tauri/binaries/pi-<target>.
# Takes ~30s. Run once per dev machine; binaries are gitignored.
./scripts/build-pi-sidecar.sh
```

### Run in dev

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
pnpm tauri dev
```

Tauri launches the Next.js dev server (port 3000) and a window pointing at it. The pi sidecar is spawned automatically from the bundled binary.

#### Dev backdoor: `PI_BIN`

If you're iterating on pi itself, point at any pi build to bypass the sidecar:

```bash
export PI_BIN=/absolute/path/to/your/pi
pnpm tauri dev
```

This skips `tauri-plugin-shell` entirely and uses raw `tokio::process::Command`.

### Build

```bash
./scripts/build-pi-sidecar.sh   # if you haven't already
pnpm tauri build
```

Outputs `.app` / `.dmg` on macOS. A real multi-size icon set is required for `tauri build` (lives under `src-tauri/icons/`, regenerate with `pnpm tauri icon <path-to-1024px.png>`).

```

- **Conversations** are pi `.jsonl` session files under `<app-data>/sessions/`. We index them (id, title, session_file, model, timestamps, archived_at) in SQLite at `<app-data>/cetus.db`.
- **Switching**: `switch_session` + `get_messages` replays history. One pi process for the app lifetime.
- **Streaming**: pi emits `agent_start`, `message_update` with `assistantMessageEvent` deltas, and `tool_execution_*` events. The frontend `chatReducer` folds these into stable `RenderedMessage[]` indexed by `contentIndex`, with a `toolCallId → block` side-table to route execution updates.
- **Framing**: strict-LF JSONL. `tauri-plugin-shell` delivers stdout in arbitrary byte chunks, so the reader maintains its own accumulator and emits one line per `\n`, stripping optional `\r`. Generic line readers that split on Unicode separators (Node `readline`) are non-compliant.
- **Sidecar packaging**: `src-tauri/binaries/pi-<target>` ships inside `.app/Contents/Resources/`. `PI_BIN` env var is the dev backdoor for iterating on pi.
- **CLI runtimes**: conversations on **Claude Code** / **Codex** / **DeepSeek Harness** bypass the pi RPC entirely — `cetus-bridge::cli_agent` keeps a conversation-scoped Claude (or DeepSeek Harness) streaming session or Codex app-server thread alive, and a unit-tested `EventTranslator` maps their events into the same PiEvent stream `chatReducer` already consumes. Context and background terminals persist across turns via the vendor session/thread; optional per-conversation git worktrees isolate edits.
- **Extension UI**: when a pi extension calls `ctx.ui.select()` etc., pi sends `extension_ui_request` over the event stream. The frontend `DialogHost` renders a dialog and replies via the `extension_ui_respond` Tauri command.
- **Bridge**: Cetus also intercepts known extension host tunnels and routes them to native handlers. See [docs/bridge.md](docs/bridge.md) for the protocol, security boundary, and open-source extraction plan.

## Reusable bridge packages

The host/extension bridge is factored into two standalone, provider-neutral packages you can depend on without pulling in the rest of the app:

- **[`cetus-bridge`](src-tauri/cetus-bridge)** (Rust crate) — the product-light host runtime: JSONL subprocess RPC around `pi --mode rpc`, deterministic extension loading, host-tunnel classification, and injectable `EventSink` / `TaskSpawner` traits. Tauri, app storage, and model-provider choices stay out of the crate — they live in app-side adapters (`tauri_bridge.rs`, `app_event.rs`, `model_bridge.rs`). `examples/minimal_host.rs` shows the smallest integration.
- **[`@cetus/bridge-protocol`](packages/cetus-bridge-protocol)** (TypeScript) — the extension-side protocol: the shared `HOST_TUNNELS` sentinels, `callHost()`, `toolResult()`, and host-tunnel types.

Both are MIT-licensed and carry no Cetus- or DeepSeek-specific code, so other agent hosts can reuse the same bridge. See [docs/bridge.md](docs/bridge.md) for the protocol and security boundary.
