# DSH Thinking Status Customizer

[中文](README.zh.md)

A CSS-only DSH Web plugin that customizes the visible running-turn text and its two-color flow effect without modifying DSH source or rewriting the status DOM.

## Install

Install the tagged release into a Web profile, inspect the resolved configuration, then restart DSH Web:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Dbi-Eshuh/dsh-thinking-status-customizer#v0.1.0
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Open the floating **思考状态** button after restart. The dialog can enable or disable the visual replacement, change its text, choose two flow colors, save the settings, or restore defaults.

The settings panel inherits DSH Web's light or dark theme tokens and previews text and color edits before they are saved.

Remove the plugin and restart DSH Web to restore the built-in presentation:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-thinking-status-customizer
```

## Behavior and privacy

The default visual text is `正在吃饭中...`. Settings are stored only in browser `localStorage` under `dsh-thinking-status-customizer:v1`; the plugin sends no settings, status text, or model interaction over the network. Missing, corrupt, or unavailable storage resolves to defaults without stopping the page.

The stylesheet targets only `[data-conversation-scroll] [role="status"][aria-live="polite"]`. It adds a layout-participating pseudo-element and plugin-owned CSS properties; it does not observe the page, replace `textContent`, or target other live-status elements. Disabling or unloading the plugin removes its style, controls, attributes, CSS properties, and event listeners.

The original DSH status remains in the accessibility tree. This plugin therefore changes visual copy only; assistive technology continues to receive the built-in status text.

## Compatibility

The current release is tested with DSH Web `0.1.0-rc.6`. It relies on the semantic selector above because `ui-conversation` does not expose a running-status text provider in that release. A DSH update that changes the selector can make the visual replacement inactive; the plugin remains loaded and its dialog reports that it is waiting for a matching status.

This package uses only the public DSH bundle and client-module loading declarations. It does not patch `ui-conversation` or depend on private DSH build helpers.

## Develop and verify

```sh
npm install
npm run verify
```

`lib/index.js` and `lib/client.js` are committed so GitHub installation does not require an install-time build. `npm run verify` type-checks, tests, rebuilds, confirms the committed bundles match the source, and previews the package contents.

## Model Experience

None. The plugin adds no tool, prompt, model-visible input or output, session event, or model behavior. It changes only browser-local presentation of an existing running status.
