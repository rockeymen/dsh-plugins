# Awesome DSH Plugin [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated guide to [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) — DeepSeek's open-source, everything-is-a-plugin coding agent — and the best community plugins built on it.

DeepSeek Harness is a runnable coding agent (Web UI + headless) built on [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), where every part of the system — models, tools, sandboxes, session storage, UI, even the agent loop itself — is a swappable plugin. That architecture has produced a large, fast-moving plugin ecosystem: well over a thousand community plugins at last count. This list exists to make that ecosystem easy to scan: what a plugin does, in one line, sorted into the category you'd actually go looking under.

> [!WARNING]
> Installing any third-party `dsh` plugin runs its code on your machine with your own permissions. Being listed here is not a security review — read the source before installing, especially for plugins that touch credentials, the network, or your filesystem.

## What is DeepSeek Harness?

[`deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) is DeepSeek's open-source agent harness, currently in developer preview. Its defining idea is **everything is a plugin**: the model provider, the sandbox, the tool set, the session store, and the UI are all plugins loaded into a Cordis-based runtime, so you can replace or extend any layer without forking the harness itself. Plugins declare a `dsh.bundle` manifest and install with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add <plugin-name>
```

## Getting Started

```sh
# run the Web UI (served at http://127.0.0.1:3080 by default)
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web

# or from a source checkout
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness && pnpm install && pnpm run build && pnpm dsh web
```

Tag your own plugin repo with the [`dsh-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) GitHub topic so it's discoverable, and consider a plugin browser for one-click install/upgrade from inside the Web UI.

## Writing Your Own Plugin

1. Scaffold a `dsh.bundle` manifest declaring what your plugin extends (model, tool, sandbox, UI, session store, or the agent loop itself).
2. Tag the repo with the [`dsh-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) GitHub topic for discoverability.
3. Install locally with `dsh plugin --profile web add <path-or-name>` to iterate.
4. Read [deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)'s architecture docs and AGENTS.md before building anything that touches the core agent loop.
