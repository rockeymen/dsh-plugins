# pi2dsh

**English** | [中文](README.zh.md)

**Bridging the Pi and DeepSeek Harness ecosystems.** pi2dsh is dedicated to connecting [Pi](https://pi.dev/)'s extension ecosystem with [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH): one general **Pi Host ABI compatibility layer** that runs unmodified Pi extensions as native DSH plugins — not per-package patches.

```sh
# one bundle, any Pi packages, no conversion
pi2dsh host --packages '@juicesharp/rpiv-web-tools@2.4.0,pi-simplify@0.2.3' --out ./my-pi-host
dsh plugin --profile headless add file:$PWD/my-pi-host
```

## Architecture

The bridge implements Pi's public extension surface **once**, mapping every call onto DSH's native services. A package that sticks to Pi's public API runs verbatim; capabilities with no safe mapping fail explicitly instead of faking success.

DeepSeek Harness native services (Cordis composition)

Three delivery modes:

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Host bundle** (recommended) | One installable DSH bundle mounts any list of unmodified Pi packages as ordinary npm dependencies |
| **Convert** | A reviewable per-package bundle: vendored source snapshot + machine-readable compatibility report, for supply-chain-sensitive installs |
| **MCP config translation** | Pi's six `mcpServers` layers → official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` patch entries. The Pi MCP adapter's code never runs; `$VAR` becomes `!!js process.env.VAR`, literal secrets are warned about |

Three hard rules keep it general:

1. The core contains **no `if (packageName === …)`** branching.
2. Every capability has a **public-API contract test** (`pnpm test`, 55 tests); "some plugin loads" is never the success criterion.
3. The top-50 corpus is verified **black-box only**: failures file public ABI gaps, and fixing one gap unlocks every package that hits it (e.g. one jiti subpath-alias fix unlocked 4 packages at once).

## Progress: Pi catalog top 50 by monthly downloads

Status as of 2026-08-14. Static analysis screens; the black-box run certifies. Full per-package machine-readable evidence in [community/](community/).

| Tier | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Tested working** | **49 / 50** | Mounted in a real DSH runtime AND real execution verified: 42 returned success, 7 ran their business logic end-to-end and rejected the synthetic probe arguments (2 of the 49 verified through host mode). Real-service coverage along the way: a real LSP subprocess, real web search/fetch, PNG generation, a real MCP stdio server bridged end-to-end, real child-`pi` dispatch answered by a live model, real DeepSeek search on user credentials, and the official `dsh plugin` add/activate/remove flow |
| 🟡 **Mounts, not fully verified** | **1 / 50** | `@alexanderfortin/pi-deepseek-usage` — a pure event-hook package: all four lifecycle subscriptions attach, but every handler is gated on an active DeepSeek model session (it fetches billing usage and renders a footer), so a black-box probe has no safely-assertable callable surface. A harness limit, not a package or bridge gap |
| ❌ **Not yet supported** | **0 / 50** | The last four Pi-internal-runtime packages are bridged: vendored built-in tool constructors, provider factories, a real-semantics `ExtensionRunner` facade, and `createAgentSession` driving genuine DSH child agents |
| **Total mountable today** | **50 / 50** | 48 through convert/host bundles directly; 2 snapshot-limited packages through host mode ([evidence](community/host-mode-results.json)) |

The v6 harness also hardened the probe methodology itself: the bridge's own host-native surface (e.g. the built-in `/login` command) is measured by mounting a zero-contribution fixture extension and subtracted from every probe, so a grade reflects the package's own increment only; unsafe-name screening is word-level (`litellm_skill_list` is not a "kill" tool); and the fixture environment serves a real MCP stdio server, a LiteLLM-gateway-shaped skills API, image-model settings under Pi's config-dir contract, and — opt-in via `PI2DSH_BLACKBOX_PI_BIN` + `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` — real child-`pi` dispatch answered by a live model.

Additional verified layers: a **host bundle** mounting two unmodified packages passed the official plugin-manager flow end-to-end; a **real model run** (`deepseek-v4-flash`) called a migrated Pi tool with the durable session log asserted and zero credential persistence ([evidence](community/live-deepseek-results.json)).

### How the last four internal-runtime packages were bridged

Each landed as a reusable public-surface bridge, not a package patch: `pi-landstrip` and `pi-fabric` run on Pi's built-in tool constructors (bash/read/edit/write/grep/find/ls) vendored byte-identical with their pure-logic closure; `pi-provider-litellm` runs on the vendored pi-ai `createProvider` factory — providers key by `id` and the registry's `getProviderAuth` runs Pi's full credential chain (stored OAuth → stored key → the package's own env resolution), while model transports stay native to DSH llm; `pi-fabric` additionally hooks a real-semantics `ExtensionRunner` facade — patching `prototype.getAllRegisteredTools` genuinely filters the tool catalog, as under Pi; `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` runs on `createAgentSession` bridged to genuine DSH child agents through `ctx.agents` — the bridge owns no model loop, so compositions without one fail explicitly instead of simulating a subagent.

### How the screener judges compatibility

The screener models **load-time vs lazy reachability**: only an unresolvable dependency on the load-time static closure blocks a package — function-body dynamic imports, files reached only through dynamic import, and worker/data assets are lazy paths that behave identically under Pi and are graded as reviewable, never fatal. `bun:*` is treated like `node:*` (a host builtin of Pi's Bun-compiled distribution), and snapshots preserve the published file layout byte for byte. These rules are contract-tested; under them, packages that mix Bun-only branches, optional heavyweight dependencies, or bundler-generated worker paths — `pi-hermes-memory`, `@mjasnikovs/pi-task`, `pi-harness-runtime`, `mitsupi`, `pi-lens` — all mount and work as published, with no changes needed upstream.

### Roadmap

1. ✅ Done: the 9 "mounts, not fully verified" lifted — 8 grade tested-working (credentialed fixtures, a real MCP stdio server, a live-agent probe path for userQuestions, Pi-config-dir settings, real child-`pi` dispatch, and two registry-semantics fixes in the bridge: providers keyed by `id`, and `getProviderAuth` running Pi's full credential chain instead of OAuth only); the 1 remaining is a pure event-hook package graded honestly as having no probeable surface.
2. ✅ Done: interactive OAuth host seam — Pi provider `oauth.login/refreshToken/getApiKey` flows run on DSH-native interaction, credentials persist with Pi's `auth.json` semantics with double-checked-lock refresh, and the four official Pi flows ship built in; verified end-to-end against a real ChatGPT Pro account (see "Interactive OAuth" above).
3. ✅ Done: all four Pi-internal-runtime packages bridged (see above) — every top-50 package mounts.
4. ✅ Done: the 2 snapshot-limited packages verified through host mode ([evidence](community/host-mode-results.json)).
5. ✅ Done: load-time vs lazy reachability screening landed; the five packages it unblocked all mount, four tested-working (see above).

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22.19+ and DeepSeek Harness.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weijiafu14/pi2dsh.git && cd pi2dsh
corepack pnpm@11.7.0 install && pnpm build

node dist/cli.mjs inspect @narumitw/pi-lsp          # compatibility report
node dist/cli.mjs convert @narumitw/pi-lsp --out ./dsh-pi-lsp
node dist/cli.mjs host --packages 'pi-simplify' --out ./pi-host
node dist/cli.mjs mcp-config                        # Pi mcpServers → DSH patch
dsh plugin --profile headless add file:$PWD/pi-host
```

## Interactive OAuth: sign in with your subscription

DSH ships static HTTP headers only; pi2dsh adds the interactive OAuth layer from the Pi ecosystem. Any Pi provider package that registers an `oauth` block gets a working `/login <provider>` command on DSH, driven by the package's own protocol code. Pi's four official flows ship built in (vendored byte-identical): **OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT Plus/Pro)**, **Anthropic**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Kimi Code**.

```sh
# inside a DSH session with a pi2dsh host bundle mounted
/login openai-codex     # prints the authorization URL, spins up the localhost callback
# → approve in your browser; the credential lands in auth.json (0600)
```

What you get, end to end: PKCE + `localhost:1455` callback (device-code fallback for headless boxes), credentials persisted in Pi's `auth.json` format — so packages like `@narumitw/pi-accounts` manage the same file they already know — automatic refresh with Pi's double-checked-lock rotation (5-minute expiry window, refreshed token persisted before release), and `getProviderAuth`/`getApiKeyForProvider` on the extension registry returning live keys.

**And the token drives real model calls through DSH's native LLM path.** `pi2dsh/credentials-oauth` is a standard `dsh-credentials` provider: any reference shaped `PI2DSH_OAUTH_<PROVIDER>` resolves per request from `auth.json` (running the refresh rotation on the way), everything else falls through to the environment. Point an official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai` route at it and `ctx.llm.stream()` runs on your subscription:

```yaml
- id: llm
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai'
  config:
    providers:
      openai-codex:
        apiKeyEnv: PI2DSH_OAUTH_OPENAI_CODEX
        models:
          - id: gpt-5.6-luna
```

Both layers are verified against a real ChatGPT Pro account: browser authorization → callback → token exchange → store → refreshable key (`scripts/verify-oauth-e2e.mjs`), then credentials provider → official pi-ai route → DSH-native `ctx.llm.stream()` → a real model reply on the subscription (`scripts/verify-oauth-llm-e2e.mjs`). On networks that need a proxy, both scripts honor `HTTPS_PROXY`.

## Compatibility boundaries (explicit, never silent)

| Area | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Tools | Native DSH tools; Pi's in-place `tool_call` argument mutation works for Pi-owned tools (DSH-native tools reject it — DSH logs arguments before policy) |
| Sessions | Messages project from DSH's durable log; Pi custom entries/labels/names persist in a pi2dsh sidecar (DSH has no out-of-repo plugin-event channel yet) |
| Pi TUI | Pure logic vendored byte-identical; components construct headlessly; `ui.custom` resolves `undefined` exactly like Pi's own rpc mode |
| Providers/OAuth | Interactive OAuth is live: `/login <provider>` runs the package's own flow, credentials persist in Pi's `auth.json` with automatic refresh; model transports stay native to DSH `llm` |
| Model runtime | `modelRegistry` projects the live DSH llm directory as Pi Model objects (refreshed on `llm/adapters-updated`); `ctx.model` reflects the agent's real route; `setModel`/`setThinkingLevel` switch the loop through the `agent/request` waterfall; pi-ai `complete()`/`stream()` run REAL calls through `ctx.llm.stream()` with two-way message conversion (verified against a live model: `scripts/verify-model-bridge-e2e.mjs`) |
| Session tree writes | `fork`/`navigateTree`/`switchSession` fail explicitly (DSH lists pi-style entry trees as deferred) |
| Terminal decoration | footer/statusline/shortcuts register but never fire — matching Pi's own non-TUI modes |
