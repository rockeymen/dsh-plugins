# dsh-skin

Skin switcher + custom wallpaper for DeepSeek Harness — a "change the skin"
feature in the spirit of Codex themes. It registers a curated catalog of
palettes into DSH's built-in theme runtime and adds two rows to
**Settings → General** (below the built-in Appearance row):

- **皮肤 / Skins** — pick one of 7 curated palettes (or **默认 / Default** to
  follow the built-in appearance).
- **背景图片 / Wallpaper** — set your own background image with opacity and
  blur controls.

Both choices persist across reloads (localStorage).

## How it works

DSH's theme system is token-based: the web shell ships `--dsw-*` design tokens,
and `ThemeRuntime` lets third-party plugins register themes that override the
alias layer (`--dsw-alias-*`) per color scheme. This package is a regular
dual-face plugin:

- **Host half** (`lib/index.js`) — a `dsh.bundle` patch layer that inserts one
  loader entry (`skin`); a no-op `apply`, exactly like the shipped ui-* packages.
- **Browser half** (`lib/client.js`) — a `dsh.client` bundle (served at
  `/plugins/dsh-skin/client.js`) that:
  1. registers 7 curated skins via `ctx.theme.register(...)`;
  2. restores the saved skin id and applies it with `ctx.theme.setTheme(...)`;
  3. renders the wallpaper as a fixed backdrop layer (`z-index: -1`) and stacks
     a token override (`ctx.theme.overrideTokens`) that makes the main canvas
     (`--dsw-alias-bg-base`) and sidebar (`--dsw-specific-sidebar-fill`)
     translucent, so the image shows through while inner surfaces (cards,
     inputs, bubbles) stay opaque and readable;
  4. keeps the slot stores in sync with `theme/change` (and re-shades the
     wallpaper when the active skin or light/dark scheme changes);
  5. mounts both rows into `settings.general.item`.

Each skin sets its `colorScheme` (`light`/`dark`), which drives
`body[data-ds-dark-theme]`, plus alias-token overrides applied as inline custom
properties on `<body>` by ui-layout's ThemePresenter.

## Skins

| id        | scheme | vibe                              |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| `ocean`   | dark   | DeepSeek-blue deep sea            |
| `graphite`| dark   | neutral monochrome                |
| `forest`  | dark   | green calm                        |
| `sunset`  | dark   | warm purple                       |
| `midnight`| dark   | pure black OLED                   |
| `paper`   | light  | warm paper                        |
| `sakura`  | light  | pink accents                      |

Picking **默认 / Default** reverts to the built-in appearance (follow system)
and clears the stored skin.

## Wallpaper

In **Settings → General → 背景图片 / Wallpaper**:

- **选择图片 / Choose image** — pick a local image (≤ 2MB, stored as a data
  URL, kept in this browser only).
- **透明度 / Opacity** and **模糊 / Blur** sliders tune how the image sits
  behind the UI.
- **移除图片 / Remove** clears it.

The wallpaper lives on a `z-index: -1` fixed layer, so it is only visible
through the translucent main canvas and sidebar; message surfaces keep their
solid backgrounds for readability. It also follows your active skin's tint
(switching skins re-shades the translucent surfaces).

## Persistence

Choices are stored in `localStorage` (`dsh-skin:skin`, `dsh-skin:wallpaper`,
`dsh-skin:wallpaper-opacity`, `dsh-skin:wallpaper-blur`).
DSH's Host settings wire only exposes an allowlisted set of namespaces to
browser clients (`WEB_SETTINGS_NAMESPACES` in `dsh-host-apiproxy`), so a
third-party namespace would answer `settings-not-exposed`; the product itself
keeps remote browser preferences process-local, and localStorage matches that
boundary for a visual preference while surviving reloads on the same origin.

## Install

From anywhere, add the package to the `web` profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add -w /path/to/dsh-skin
```

> The `-w` flag is required: every profile ships a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so
> pnpm 9 treats the profile directory as a workspace root and refuses a bare
> `add` with `ERR_PNPM_ADDING_TO_ROOT`.

This runs pnpm in `~/.dsh/profiles/web`, installs the package, and appends it
to `dsh.profile.bundles` (its patch layer inserts the `skin` loader entry).
The running web server must be restarted to pick up the new bundle layer:

```sh
# stop the running instance, then:
dsh web
```

Open **Settings → General** to use both features.

## Publishing (npm)

DSH (rc.6) has **no separate plugin marketplace** — the plugin distribution
channel *is* the npm registry. A package that declares `dsh.bundle` (host patch
layer) and `dsh.client` (browser bundle) is exactly what `dsh plugin
--profile <name> add <package>` installs, so publishing this package to npm is
what "上架" means today:

1. Pick a unique name (scoped names are safer, e.g. `@yourscope/dsh-skin`) and
   fill in `author`, `repository`, `keywords`, and a CHANGELOG.
2. Make sure `files` ships `lib/index.js`, `lib/client.js`, `lib/types`,
   `cordis.patch.yml` (already configured).
3. Publish to the **official npm registry** (this machine's default registry is
   a mirror — publishing to a mirror does not reach npmjs):
   ```sh
   npm publish --registry https://registry.npmjs.org
   ```
4. Users install with:
   ```sh
   dsh plugin --profile web add -w @yourscope/dsh-skin
   ```
   then restart `dsh web`.

Known platform boundaries to document for users: browser-side preferences are
stored in localStorage (third-party settings namespaces are not exposed over
the wire yet), and the client bundle may only `require` module-table entities
(platform seeds + registered client bundles).

## Development

The client bundle is written directly in the `__ModuleLoader__` bundle format
(the same shape tsdown emits for the shipped `ui-*` packages), so no build step
is required. `lib/client.js` may `require` only module-table entities: platform
seed words (`react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, …) and registered client bundles
(`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime/client`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-theme/client`,
…). After editing, restart the web server (bundle content is re-hashed and
served with a new `rev`; loader entries are rescanned at boot).
