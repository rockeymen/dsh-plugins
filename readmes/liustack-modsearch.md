Models like DeepSeek-V4-Flash have no web access, or a weak one. ModSearch is a plug-in that greatly strengthens the model's web search, X search, and single-page fetch.

## Talk to us

Something broken, or something missing? [Open an issue](https://github.com/liustack/modsearch/issues/new/choose). For everything else, come find me on X: **[@liustack](https://x.com/liustack)**. What you built with it, which harness you are on, what should come next. New releases land there first, and a proper community space is on the way.

## Features

- **🌐 The web plugin for DeepSeek Harness (dsh):** one command, `npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add @liustack/modsearch@latest`, and dsh's built-in `web_search` runs on the modsearch engine chain with no API key, keeping its native citation cards. Two tools dsh does not have land beside it: `x_search` for X (Twitter) and `read_page` for focused single-page reading. Details in [harness setup](docs/harness-setup.md#deepseek-harness-dsh).
- **Completely free.** The default channel is Antigravity CLI, no API key needed. All three fallback channels (Tavily, Exa, Firecrawl) offer monthly free tiers with no card required.
- **Automatic failover.** When a channel fails or exhausts its quota, the next one takes over.
- **Searches X (Twitter).** With Grok Build installed, ModSearch queries the corpus that web indexes cannot reach.
- **Install once, use everywhere.** Works in Claude Code, Codex, Pi, and OpenCode.

## Supported engines

Any one of these makes search work. Configure with one command each, keys are stored in `~/.modsearch/config.json` (0600, masked when shown):

| Engine | Does | Free tier | Turn it on |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Antigravity CLI | web search + page fetch | free, browser sign-in | install `agy` and sign in |
| Tavily | web search | 1,000 credits/month, no card | `modsearch config set tavily.apiKey <key>` |
| Exa | web search | $10/month recurring credit (~1,400 searches), no card | `modsearch config set exa.apiKey <key>` |
| Firecrawl | web search + page fetch | 1,000 credits/month, search even works keyless | `modsearch config set firecrawl.apiKey <key>` |
| Grok Build | X (Twitter) search | rides SuperGrok or X Premium | install `grok` and sign in |
| local | page fetch | built in, nothing to install | nothing |

Keys can also come from the environment (`TAVILY_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`). Multiple engines configured means automatic failover, best first. Using a Tavily-, Exa-, or Firecrawl-compatible third-party or self-hosted endpoint? Point the engine at it: `modsearch config set tavily.baseURL <url>`. Every knob, engine by engine, is in the [configuration guide](skills/modsearch/references/configure.md).

## Installation

**Step 1, set up a search engine (the only part that needs your hands).** The default engine, Antigravity CLI, requires a browser sign-in that only you can complete:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash
agy                                                           # sign in, then exit
```

Prefer not to install it? Register a free key with Tavily, Exa, or Firecrawl instead (Tavily 1,000 credits a month, Exa about 1,400 searches a month, Firecrawl 1,000 credits a month, no card required by any of them).

**Step 2, hand the rest to your AI.** Send it this line, along with the key if you chose one:

> Install and configure the modsearch skill following https://github.com/liustack/modsearch/blob/main/INSTALL.md, then run the health check and tell me the result.

## Usage

Once installed, just chat. Ask anything that needs checking, or paste a URL, and the skill triggers on its own: it picks an engine, runs the search or fetch, and the answer comes back with sources.

## See it work

Both screenshots are unedited runs from the Codex desktop app, driving a DeepSeek-V4-Flash that has no web access of its own.

Give it a blog link and ask what the post says. Twenty-five seconds later: a structured summary of the whole post, with no browser involved.

Give it no target at all, just "anything interesting in AI today?". Thirty-six seconds later: six sourced stories, with a closing note on which details came from aggregation and deserve a second look. The note comes from the `uncertainty` field.

## Contributing

ModSearch does not accept pull requests. The project is maintained by a single author who reviews every line, which is a deliberate choice for reliability. Two effective ways to contribute:

- **[Open an issue](https://github.com/liustack/modsearch/issues).** Bugs, suggestions, confusing errors, unclear docs. Issues are read and shape what gets built next.
- **Fork it.** Under MIT your copy is fully yours to modify and publish.

## Shameless plug

This project runs on LIUSTACK Skills: `shaping` before you build, `coding` while you build, `dig` when it breaks, `snapshot` when you hand off. Lighter than Superpowers, and stronger.

```bash
npx -y skills add liustack/liustack -g
```
