DeepSeek Flow turns a `WORKFLOW.md` and its step-level `STEP.md` files into an editable diagram inside DeepSeek Harness. The bundled Skill lets the current Session create and maintain workflows through tools, while the diagram and Markdown remain synchronized and portable.

It is intentionally an editor—not a workflow runtime. DeepSeek Flow helps you design, inspect, and improve a workflow; execution remains in the current Session.

## What it gives you

- **Markdown as the source of truth** — one master `WORKFLOW.md`, plus one `STEP.md` workspace for each step.
- **A real visual editor** — create, move, connect, reconnect, label, and delete nodes and arrows.
- **Two-way synchronization** — edits made on the canvas and in the Markdown editor are written back to the workflow files.
- **Source-aware topology transactions** — human canvas edits receive a full current-Session review; topology produced by direct Session file edits can use an invisible deterministic finalize path instead of being sent back to the same Session.
- **Executable gate semantics** — the exported contract includes formulas, operands, predicates, and deterministic Boolean results without running Agent steps.
- **Per-session isolation** — each Harness session keeps its own workflows, with optional shared templates; the canvas toolbar can delete the current workflow or shared template behind a guarded confirm (managed workspaces move to a trash area and can be recovered).
- **Comfortable large-flow navigation** — collapsible and resizable side panels, pan and zoom, fit-to-view, animated node focus, and independent scrolling regions; node drags commit once on pointer release and background sync polls lightweight revisions, so large graphs stay smooth.
- **Native theme support** — the interface follows Harness light and dark themes and the active WebUI language.
- **Manual AI assistance** — run logic validation, optimize one document with review, or optimize the complete workflow.
- **Background AI jobs** — switching documents, views, or sessions does not interrupt accepted jobs; document proposals are restored when you return.
- **Persistent results and drafts** — logic-validation findings, AI proposals, and unapplied canvas drafts are persisted to disk: view switches, session switches, and `dsh web` restarts lose nothing; they are cleared only by an explicit discard or a successful commit. Markdown edits inside the 650 ms autosave window are flushed immediately when you leave the view.
- **I/O and memory safeguards** — unchanged documents are never rewritten (autosaves no longer grind the SSD), assist history and drafts live in separate files, result polling uses single-key queries with failure and duration caps, every background poll is cancellable with no leaks, and subagents get a 10-minute default timeout.
- **A bundled Agent Skill** — installs with the plugin, documents every workflow tool, and includes executable IF/ELSE and Boolean-gate examples.

## Quick start

Install from GitHub into the Web profile:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:kanghelyu/dsh-deepseek-flow#main"
```

Restart `dsh web`, open a session, and select the **DeepSeek Flow** tab.

To confirm that the plugin is mounted:

```bash
dsh web --dump-config | grep deepseek-flow
```

## Your first workflow

1. In a Session, ask the Agent to **build a workflow** or **import a workflow**. The bundled `deepseek-flow` Skill guides it to `flow_create` or `flow_put`.
2. Open **DeepSeek Flow**. The plugin scaffolds a master document, step documents, and their visual layout.
3. Ask the Session Agent to change the workflow files, or select a document and edit its Markdown directly.
4. Direct Session/file-driven topology updates are finalized without another main-Session review. The Agent should call `flow_finalize_canvas`; if it forgets, Studio falls back to detecting that no canvas edit event occurred and presses the same invisible finalize action automatically.
5. When **you** add, remove, rename, or connect boxes on the canvas, click **Apply changes**. DeepSeek Flow validates the graph, asks the current Session Agent to review it, validates again, and atomically saves a new revision.
6. Return to the Session when you want the Agent to execute the workflow.

A typical workflow directory looks like this:

```text
my-workflow/
├── WORKFLOW.md
├── 01-input/
│   └── STEP.md
├── 02-research/
│   └── STEP.md
├── 03-quality-check/
│   └── STEP.md
└── 04-output/
    └── STEP.md
```

## Agent tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `flow_create` | Create a documented linear or branched workflow and save it in the current Session. |
| `flow_list` / `flow_read` | Discover workflows and read the master document, step documents, revision, graph, and logic contract. |
| `flow_put` | Import or atomically update a complete flow definition. A successful call is already persisted. |
| `flow_evaluate` | Evaluate Boolean gates from upstream values without running Agent steps. |
| `flow_finalize_canvas` | After direct file edits, queue Studio's invisible deterministic finalize action and skip a redundant main-Session review. |
| `flow_delete` | Delete a Session flow or shared template; managed workspaces are moved to trash. |

The Skill is registered reactively when the Harness `skills` service becomes available. Its `SKILL.md` contains real Markdown after frontmatter, so filesystem and runtime providers never return an empty instruction body.

## Logic gates

Condition boxes support eight gate types: **IF/ELSE, AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR**. Gate metadata controls connection labels, outgoing limits, and the Boolean contract exported to the current Session.

| Gate | Connection behavior | Boolean result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IF / ELSE** | One **Yes** and one **No** branch at most. | Selects exactly the branch matching the condition result. |
| **AND / NAND** | Multiple distinct targets; labels are automatic. | Evaluates all known operands, with NAND negating AND. |
| **OR / NOR** | Multiple distinct targets; labels are automatic. | Evaluates all known operands, with NOR negating OR. |
| **XOR / XNOR** | Multiple distinct targets; labels are automatic. | Evaluates parity, with XNOR negating XOR. |
| **NOT** | Exactly one automatically labeled outgoing arrow. | Negates its single input. |

Duplicate targets, duplicate Yes/No branches, excess IF/ELSE or NOT arrows, invalid aggregate input arity, unmarked cycles, and unknown box kinds are rejected with actionable validation messages. A retry loop is allowed only as an explicit feedback edge with a finite `maxIterations` and a non-empty `exitCondition`; feedback edges do not participate in one-pass Boolean evaluation or automatic Agent execution. Legacy true/false branches are normalized to IF/ELSE.

The `flow_evaluate` tool can deterministically evaluate gate state and activated targets from upstream step results. It does not run Agent steps or perform workflow side effects.

Gate predicates are deliberately small and deterministic: `truthy`, `falsy`, and `nonEmpty`. Do not put a natural-language rule such as `"the user confirmed"` in `predicate`. Add an upstream Agent step that outputs JSON Boolean `true` or `false`, then connect it to a condition with `predicate: "truthy"`.

```json
{
  "id": "confirmed",
  "kind": "condition",
  "data": { "label": "Confirmed?", "gateType": "ifElse", "predicate": "truthy" }
}
```

## Reviewed topology transactions

Adding or deleting boxes, gates, arrows, inputs, or outputs **in Studio** creates a local topology draft. Persisting that user-authored draft is an explicit transaction:

```text
Local validation → current Session Agent review → second validation → atomic revision save
```

- The reviewer is the live current Session Agent, not a detached background session.
- Markdown is immutable review context: topology review cannot silently rewrite document content.
- Stale or incomplete revisions are rejected so concurrent writers cannot lose state.
- Moving a box changes layout only and auto-saves without opening a topology transaction.
- While a topology draft is pending, logic validation and whole-workflow optimization stay disabled; single-document editing and optimization remain available.
- Deleted managed workflows and generated step directories move to trash; external custom document roots are never moved automatically.

Direct Session file edits use a separate trusted path:

```text
Session edits files → optional flow_finalize_canvas signal → deterministic validation → atomic save
```

The finalize control exists in Studio but is hidden and cannot be clicked through the normal UI. Studio records every user topology edit handler. If a topology difference appears without any such canvas event, it is treated as external/file-driven and the hidden action is pressed automatically. If deterministic validation fails, the draft is preserved and the normal **Apply changes** path remains available. This fallback means correctness does not depend solely on the Agent remembering the tool call.

## AI document assistant

Every AI action is started manually. DeepSeek Flow never runs validation or optimization behind your back.

| Action | Scope | What happens before files change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Logic validation** | All workflow documents and arrow relationships | The Agent returns clickable errors and warnings; no file is changed. |
| **Optimize current document** | The selected `WORKFLOW.md` or `STEP.md` only | A complete proposal appears in the preview. You must **Accept** or **Reject** it. |
| **Optimize entire workflow** | `WORKFLOW.md` and every `STEP.md` | A warning is shown first. After confirmation, the Agent rewrites and saves the complete set directly. There is no per-document review or built-in undo. |

For whole-workflow optimization, commit or back up important Markdown files first. If a document changes while an optimization is running, DeepSeek Flow refuses to overwrite the newer content.

The assistant uses an isolated Agent job and does not run the workflow. Model and reasoning-effort controls are available in the assistant menu.

Topology review is the exception: it deliberately uses the live current Session Agent because that Session owns the workflow context. Document validation and optimization continue to use isolated one-shot Agent jobs.

## Design boundaries

DeepSeek Flow deliberately does **not** provide:

- a workflow execution button or runtime;
- API-key, provider, or credential management;
- triggers, schedules, webhooks, or execution history;
- a replacement for normal Session interaction.

That boundary keeps the plugin focused: edit and validate in DeepSeek Flow, execute in the Session.

## Local development

Clone the repository and link it into your Web profile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanghelyu/dsh-deepseek-flow.git
cd dsh-deepseek-flow
dsh plugin --profile web add "link:$PWD"
```

Useful checks:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run smoke
```

If an older local Harness installation is missing linked dependencies, stop `dsh web` before running:

```bash
bash scripts/ensure-deps.sh
```

After changing client code, rebuild and hard-refresh the browser. Host changes require restarting `dsh web`.

## Troubleshooting

- **The tab does not appear:** verify the plugin with `dsh web --dump-config`, then restart the Web profile.
- **The UI looks stale:** rebuild with `npm run build`, restart when Host code changed, and hard-refresh the browser.
- **AI actions report no provider:** select a working model in the Session or in the assistant menu.
- **Whole-workflow optimization is rejected:** one or more documents changed while the Agent was working, or the Agent did not return every required document. Retry from the latest files.
- **Apply changes is rejected:** for a retry, add a feedback edge with a finite `maxIterations` and non-empty `exitCondition`; otherwise fix the reported ordinary cycle, missing input, branch limit, or stale revision, then submit the complete topology again.
- **Apply changes appears after a Session file edit:** wait briefly for Studio's file-origin fallback, or ask the Agent to call `flow_finalize_canvas` with the workflow id and current revision.
- **The Skill tool returns an empty body:** update the plugin and restart `dsh web`; current releases bundle a valid `skills/deepseek-flow/SKILL.md` and register it after the `skills` service is ready.
- **Recovering a deleted workflow:** managed workspaces are kept under `deepseek-flow/trash/<date>/`; copy the directory back into `workspaces/` to restore the documents, then re-import the flow JSON with `flow_put`.
