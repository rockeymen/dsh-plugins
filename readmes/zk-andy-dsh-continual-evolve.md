Continual self-evolution for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): a versioned, auditable, rollback-safe layer of harness state — prompt notes, memories, skills, and subagent specs — refined from session trajectories.

> **Status: all phases complete; in long-term maintenance.** Phases 1–3
> shipped the full evolution loop: the pure-core engine, model tools and
> the `/evolve` command, the automatic review gate (turn-interval +
> compaction checkpoints, human approval for global edits), real
> system-prompt injection (prompt notes + delegation specs, zero token
> cost when empty), and the benchmark-driven validation loop (code-owned
> scoring, non-regressive acceptance, rubric ACL). Since then the plugin
> keeps growing with usage-driven enhancements — the memory layer (ranked
> injection, trajectory citations, archive), per-installation rubric keys,
> and plugin-owned file logging. See the Roadmap for the full shipped and
> candidate lists.

## Background

This project started as a research question: *can a harness improve itself,
and what would a production-grade version look like?* Three lines of evidence
shaped the answer:

- **penguin-harness** demonstrated the concept (benchmark → evaluate →
  optimize → accept/rollback) but with **zero code-level enforcement** — every
  guarantee was a prompt contract. Its report (`docs/research/`) became the
  hardening checklist this project implements.
- **prime-agent `/refine`** proved the engineering shape: versioned harness
  entries, atomic persistence, optimistic concurrency, inverse-op rollback.
  This package is an original implementation of that shape on the DSH plugin
  surface.
- Academic work (Self-Harness, AHE, HarnessOpt-Bench) supplied the discipline:
  frozen evaluation runtime, code-owned aggregation, non-regressive
  acceptance.

The result: **the model proposes, the code guarantees.** Every mechanical
safety property (schema validation, snapshots, versioning, audit trail,
acceptance decisions) is enforced in code — never by asking the model to
behave.

## Why

Agents accumulate reusable experience in every session — repeated failures, durable facts, reusable procedures — and then forget it at the next turn or session. This plugin makes that experience first-class persistent state:

- **Versioned entries** keyed by kind (`prompt` / `memory` / `skill` / `subagent`), each with a recorded provenance and version
- **Evidence trail**: every refinement appends an event carrying `trigger / changes / evidence / outcome`
- **Deterministic rollback**: inverse edits are generated from applied results — no LLM re-guessing
- **Code-enforced safety**, not prompt discipline: schema validation, atomic writes, corrupt-file degrade, optimistic concurrency, immutable base system prompt
- **Local (session) and global (cross-session) scopes** with merge semantics

## Design provenance

Inspired by three bodies of work (see [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md)):

- **prime-agent `/refine`** (MIT): the state model, atomic persistence, optimistic concurrency, per-edit validation, and inverse-op rollback this package implements — annotated reference source in [`docs/research/prime-agent-refinement.ts`](docs/research/prime-agent-refinement.ts). The code here is an original implementation, written for the DSH plugin surface.
- **penguin-harness** (Apache-2.0): the benchmark-driven evolution loop — research report in [`docs/research/penguin-harness-self-evolution.md`](docs/research/penguin-harness-self-evolution.md); its prompt-only contracts are the anti-pattern this package hardens.
- Academic: Self-Harness (arXiv 2606.09498), AHE (arXiv 2604.25850), HarnessOpt-Bench (arXiv 2608.06301).

```
/evolve                  help + current local store
/evolve list [global]    list entries
/evolve history          applied refinements (ids for rollback)
/evolve rollback <id>    deterministically revert a refinement
/evolve plan [msg]       LLM planner against the current store
/evolve archive <id>     hide an entry from injection (data kept, restorable)
/evolve unarchive <id>   restore an archived entry
/evolve log [tail N] [session <id>]  show the recent plugin log (default 50 lines; optional per-session filter)
/evolve export <path>    backup the local store to JSON
/evolve import <path>    restore a store from an export file
/evolve mount <skillId>  hot-mount a skill entry as a live cordis plugin (tool: skill_<name>)
/evolve mount list       list hot-mounted plugins (restored on boot)
/evolve unmount <id>     remove a hot-mounted plugin
/evolve goal             show the evolution goal (round-driven auto-review)
/evolve goal <objective> create/update the evolution goal — while active, the review gate runs EVERY round
/evolve goal done        complete the evolution goal
```

Model-facing tools: `evolve_list`, `evolve_add`, `evolve_update`, `evolve_delete`, `evolve_rollback`.

## Memory layer

Beyond the persisted store itself, three features keep injected memory
"understanding you" as entries grow (gap analysis vs. Mem0 / Letta / Zep /
LangMem; no external services — everything is pure functions):

- **Ranked injection** — when a kind holds more than the 6-entry cap, the
  injected block no longer shows the fixed first six: entries are scored by
  relevance to the agent's most recent direct user messages (keyword/BM25
  level: title hits weigh 2×) and then by recency (`updated_at`, 30-day
  half-life), so the freshest *and most relevant* entries fill the cap. The
  empty-store zero-token behavior is unchanged.
- **Trajectory citations** — every newly created entry records
  `metadata.sourceSession` + `metadata.sourceSeqs` pointing at the direct
  user messages it was distilled from (DSH sessions are event-sourced with
  contiguous seqs, so the citation expands back into the durable session
  log). Listings show `src=<sessionId>:<seqs>`; old entries are not migrated
  and never error.
- **Archive** — `/evolve archive <id>` hides an entry from injection
  (`metadata.archivedAt`, data kept, rollback-compatible) and
  `/evolve unarchive <id>` restores it. Archived entries are marked
  `[archived]` in `evolve_list` and skipped by injection; the overflow count
  excludes them.
- **Global-aware gate** — the auto-review gate and planner judge the merged
  global + local state with every entry's real scope labeled, so a topic
  already covered by a global entry is declined instead of being re-sedimented
  as a local duplicate.

## Logging

Plugin-owned file logging: every cordis log message (from this plugin or any
other) is appended to `<dshHome>/evolve/plugin.log` as JSONL (0600, rotated to
`plugin.log.1` past `logMaxBytes`). It works no matter how `dsh web` is
launched — no extra component to install, no startup-script dependency.
View the tail with `/evolve log [tail N]`, or read the file directly:

```bash
tail -f ~/.dsh/evolve/plugin.log          # live
/evolve log 100                            # last 100 lines in the chat
```

For live output in a foreground terminal, the official
`@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-logger-console` plugin can be added to the
profile (optional; the file log remains the baseline that always exists).

## Benchmark-driven validation (Phase 3)

```
/evolve benchmark new <title> [runs]                   create a benchmark (runs = repeats per case, default 1)
/evolve benchmark add-case <bid> <title> <statement> <rubric>
/evolve benchmark list                                 list benchmarks
/evolve benchmark reset <bid>                          clear the scoreboard (re-run reference)
/evolve benchmark status <bid>                         scoreboard + decisions
/evolve benchmark run <bid>                            evaluate current state → reference
/evolve benchmark run <bid> candidate <refinementId>   evaluate post-refinement state → decide
```

The loop: freeze a reference score → evolve a candidate (`/evolve plan`) →
run the same case × run matrix against the post-refinement state → the
**code-owned** acceptance rule keeps the candidate only if the overall mean
strictly improves with no case regressing (Self-Harness style). The model
produces raw per-cell scores only; aggregation and decisions live in
`src/score.ts`. Rubric isolation is by construction (the planner never sees
rubric files); a rejection is recorded in the scoreboard and the refinement
is rolled back automatically (`autoRollbackOnReject`, on by default).

### Real recorded run (ACCEPT)

A live `dsh web` session, one case, one candidate — the first genuine
acceptance:

| Step | Command | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| reference | `/evolve benchmark run lint_convention` | **90** — the evaluator agent actually grepped the harness store and reported *"lint/ruff/eslint/mypy appear in zero entries"* |
| candidate | `/evolve plan 记住：写代码前必须先运行适用的 lint 检查` | creates `memory:convention_lint_before_code` |
| re-evaluate | `/evolve benchmark run lint_convention candidate <id>` | **100** — evaluator ran `evolve_list`, hit the memory, quoted it verbatim |
| decision | — | `overall: 90 → 100` · `lint_knowledge: 90 → 100` · **DECISION: ACCEPTED** |

The evaluator does not grade model common sense — it inspects the actual
harness state under test (grep, `evolve_list`) and scores against it, so a
harness change measurably moves the score. Earlier runs in the same session
produced honest `REJECTED` decisions (0 → 0 placeholder cases, and 100 → 100
where the baseline was already perfect).

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `baseDir` | resolved DSH home | root for the `evolve/` stores |
| `sectionOrder` | 118 | system-prompt section order |
| `autoReview` | `false` | enable the automatic review gate (costs a cheap model call per interval) |
| `reviewIntervalTurns` | 6 | gate runs when this many turns passed since the last review |
| `maxReviewInputChars` | 40000 | trajectory slice handed to the gate |
| `reviewBudgetTokens` | 4096 | output budget for the gate call |
| `notifyOnAutoReview` | `true` | after an approved gate run that applied edits, queue a visible follow-up notice in the session (persisted entries + rollback command) |
| `requireGlobalApproval` | `true` | cross-session (global) edits ask the user for "批准" before applying |
| `skillsDir` | `<dshHome>/skills` | root where skill entries materialize as SKILL.md bundles |
| `rubricKey` | auto-generated local key file (`<dshHome>/evolve/rubric.key`, 0600) → dev fallback | passphrase for AES-256-GCM rubric encryption (benchmark rubrics never touch the disk in plaintext). When unset, the plugin generates a random per-installation key file on first use — every install gets its own key, no setup needed; `DSH_EVOLVE_RUBRIC_KEY` is the environment-variable override |
| `logToFile` | `true` | write all cordis log messages to `<dshHome>/evolve/plugin.log` (JSONL, 0600) — plugin-owned logging works with any launch method, no extra component to install |
| `logLevel` | `1` | file log level: 0=error, 1=info, 2=warn, 3=debug |
| `logMaxBytes` | 5 MiB | rotate the log to `plugin.log.1` when it exceeds this size |
| `autoRollbackOnReject` | `true` | after a benchmark decision rejects a candidate, roll the refinement back automatically (same engine path as `/evolve rollback` — deterministic, snapshotted, audited) |

Example (profile `cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: continual-evolve
      name: 'dsh-continual-evolve'
      config:
        autoReview: true
        reviewIntervalTurns: 6
```

## Development

pnpm install        # install dev deps
pnpm build          # tsc -> lib/
pnpm test           # vitest run

## Roadmap

**Shipped**

- **Phases 1–3 (done)**: pure-core engine (state model, validation, apply, rollback, proposal parsing) → `evolve_*` tools + `/evolve` command + `ctx.llm` planner → auto-refine review gate (turn-interval + compaction checkpoints, visible follow-up notices), global-scope human approval, executable skills, real system-prompt injection (prompt notes + delegation specs, inherited by subagents), benchmark-driven validation loop (code-owned scoreboard, non-regressive acceptance, rubric isolation by construction), hot-mounted skill plugins, goal-driven evolution rounds.
- **2026-08 maintenance wave (done)**:
  - **memory layer** — ranked injection (relevance + recency scoring fills the per-kind cap), trajectory citations (`metadata.sourceSession` + `sourceSeqs`, shown as `src=session:seqs`), archive/unarchive (`/evolve archive <id>`, injection skips archived entries), global-aware gate (declines local duplicates of globally covered topics)
  - **per-installation rubric key** — auto-generated local key file (`<dshHome>/evolve/rubric.key`, 0600); no more publicly known dev key
  - **plugin-owned file logging** — every cordis log message lands in `<dshHome>/evolve/plugin.log` (JSONL, 0600, rotated), viewable via `/evolve log`; works with any launch method, no extra component to install
  - **trajectory-grounded planning** — `/evolve plan` (and every planner call, including the gate's refine step) now reads the session trajectory: the caller's recent direct user messages are extracted from the session log and fed to the planner as a `<session_trajectory>` block, so proposals are grounded in what the user actually said (explicit `trajectory` overrides; empty trajectory is omitted at zero cost)
  - **gate-proposed archiving** — stale entries are a first-class refine target: the planner can emit `action: "archive"` (kind + id only), which stamps `metadata.archivedAt` through the normal apply path — snapshot, version bump, audit event, and a deterministic rollback inverse that restores the pre-archive state. Archive hides from injection but never deletes; re-archiving an archived entry is rejected, and the base system prompt stays immutable
  - **automatic rollback on benchmark rejection** — the acceptance loop is closed: when the code-owned decision rejects a candidate, the refinement is reverted automatically through the same engine path as `/evolve rollback` (deterministic inverse edits, snapshotted and audited; configurable via `autoRollbackOnReject`, on by default). Failures report the manual fallback instead of throwing
  - **per-session log filtering** — `/evolve log [tail N] [session <id>]` keeps only the lines mentioning a given session id (exact token match, drawn from the rendered message and raw args); gate records now carry the session id in their log line

The planned/candidates list is empty for now — future work is driven by real usage.
