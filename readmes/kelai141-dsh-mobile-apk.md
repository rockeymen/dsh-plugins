Android shell for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): WebView UI
over an **embedded Termux runtime snapshot** (extract-and-run, no Termux app needed), SAF directory
bridge, keep-alive foreground service, engine watchdog, and online runtime updates. One APK to
install: it boots a full dsh web agent that can really execute bash.

## Features

- **Embedded runtime** — ships a ~70MB xz snapshot (node + bash + coreutils + dsh + plugins);
  first launch extracts in ~10s and starts the engine from the app's own files; fully offline.
- **Mobile UI** — system WebView over `http://127.0.0.1:3080` with the responsive plugin
  (drawer/sheet on phones).
- **Keep-alive** — foreground service ("dsh 引擎运行中") + 5s watchdog that restarts a dead engine.
- **Online runtime updates** — manifest-driven snapshot swap (download → sha256 → atomic switch →
  auto-restart); the running runtime can update itself without an APK update.
- **SAF bridge** — `pickDirectory` maps the picked tree to a real path (`/storage/emulated/0/…`).

## Build

Requirements: JDK 17+, Android SDK (compileSdk 36); Gradle 8.11.1 via wrapper.

```sh
# 1. Prepare the runtime snapshot (required, ~70MB, distributed as a Release asset)
#    Option A: download snapshot-x86_64.tar.xz from GitHub Releases
#    Option B: build on a Termux device (scripts/make-snapshot.sh) and pull it
mkdir -p app/src/main/assets
cp snapshot/snapshot.tar.xz app/src/main/assets/snapshot.tar.xz

# 2. Build (fails loudly when the snapshot is missing)
./gradlew assembleDebug
# output: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Bridge protocol v1 (`window.androidBridge`)

| method | signature | description |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | getter → string | bridge protocol version (`"1.0"`) for feature detection |
| `checkEngine` | () → string | probes 127.0.0.1:3080; JSON `{running, latencyMs}` |
| `keepScreenOn` | (enable: boolean) | screen-on wake lock |
| `showNotification` | (title, text) | test notification channel (POST_NOTIFICATIONS) |
| `pickDirectory` | (callbackId: string) | SAF tree picker; result async via `window.__dshBridge.onDirectoryPicked(callbackId, path)` |

The bridge decouples the APK from the dsh version: pages feature-detect on `androidBridge.version`.

## Online update protocol

1. App fetches `manifest.json`: `{url, sha256, size}` (default `http://10.0.2.2:8899/manifest.json`
   for emulator testing; production points at a release server);
2. Downloads the snapshot, verifies SHA-256, extracts to a staging dir (never touching the live tree),
   atomically swaps `usr` → `usr-old` → new `usr`, then kills the old engine — the watchdog
   restarts it from the new runtime.

Test trigger: `adb shell am start -n com.dshmobile.shell/.MainActivity -a com.dshmobile.shell.action.UPDATE`;
status is written to `files/update-status.txt`. Test server: `node scripts/snapshot-server.mjs`.

## Permissions

`INTERNET` (WebView + engine probe), `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (notification channel),
`FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` (keep-alive). SAF picking needs no permission.

## ABI & pagesize

The x86_64 snapshot is verified end-to-end. arm64 snapshots are assembled from the official
Termux aarch64 repo (see docs/design.md §ABI); a 16KB-page build must be produced on a 16KB device.
APKs are per-ABI (the snapshot inside is arch-specific).
