# dsh-drop-in

> 馃寪 涓枃鐗堬細[README.zh.md](README.zh.md)

Drag files from your system file manager straight into the DeepSeek Harness web GUI.
Files appear as a chip bar above the input box, or 鈥?with the composer focused 鈥?as a
**native reference bubble** (file pill) embedded inline in the text you are typing; they
are sent along with your message (including their **absolute paths**), and render as
file cards inside the user bubble.

## Features

- 馃搸 Drag in **any file/folder** (images are treated as files 鈥?the official image-drop overlay no longer steals the drag)
- 馃 **Inline file bubble**: with the composer focused, dropped/pasted files are inserted at the caret as a native reference pill (works mid-text, e.g. `浣犲ソ銆屾姤鍛?zip銆嶇湅涓€涓嬭繖涓枃浠禶); on send the pill expands to a reference carrying the **absolute path** (`@[filename](absolute-path)`) and the bubble renders it as a file card 鈥?the agent can read the file straight from the path
- 馃柤锔?**Clipboard paste**: pasting an image/file into the composer goes through the same pipeline instead of the native image-attachment rail
- 馃殌 Chip bar above the input: icon + name + size + path status, removable (脳), deduplicated by path
- 鉁旓笍 Messages automatically carry a `馃搸 鎷栧叆鏂囦欢` block (name, size, **absolute path**), rendered as file cards (hover for the full path)
- 馃攳 A `dropped_files` tool lets the agent list still-unsent dropped files
- 馃枼锔?Under DSH Desktop (Electron) absolute paths come from the preload bridge (`webUtils.getPathForFile` 鈥?the only path source in modern Electron)
- 馃寪 Fallback: in a plain browser (no preload bridge) text files are copied to the workspace `.dsh-drops/`, and pasted binaries are persisted there via base64, so the agent can still read them

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/lbl61/dsh-drop-in/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.0.tar.gz
```

Manual (bundle) install:
1. Extract `dsh-drop-in` into `~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/dsh-drop-in/`
2. Add `"dsh-drop-in"` to the `dsh.profile.bundles` array in `~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json`
3. Restart `dsh web` (DSH Desktop: quit fully and reopen, or run `window.dshDesktop.restartService()` in DevTools)

## Usage

1. Drag files from Explorer into the chat page (or paste an image/file into the composer)
2. Composer focused 鈫?files are inserted at the caret as **native reference bubbles** (file pills), mid-text allowed; otherwise they appear in the chip bar above the input
3. Type your message and send (Enter / Ctrl+Enter / the send button all work)
4. The bubble shows file cards 鈥?the agent receives the absolute path (`@[name](path)` or the `馃搸 鎷栧叆鏂囦欢` block) and can read the files

## How it works

- The client half intercepts file drags in the capture phase (the official image-upload flow never steals the events), keeps a per-session chip bar (`conversation.input.dock`), renders user bubbles with file cards (`conversation.chat.node` `user` key), and stitches the `馃搸 鎷栧叆鏂囦欢` block into the draft before submit (Enter, Ctrl+Enter, and the send button are all covered); with the composer focused it inserts **native reference bubbles** via the `slash/input-insert-reference` scoped event (U+FFFC occurrences rendered by the composer backdrop) and the registered `inputTriggers` codec serializes them to `@[filename](absolute-path)` on submit
- The host half keeps the per-session file registry behind the `dropped_files` tool, writes fallback text copies to `.dsh-drops/<sessionId>/`, and persists pasted binaries via the `file-copy` route (base64)
- Absolute paths under DSH Desktop rely on the preload bridge (see [preload-bridge.md](preload-bridge.md)): Electron 鈮?32 removed `File.path`

## Configuration

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Master switch (Settings 鈫?鏂囦欢鎷栧叆). When off, drag/paste falls back to built-in behavior. |

## Uninstall

1. Remove `dsh-drop-in` from the `dsh.profile.bundles` array in `~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json`
2. Delete `~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/dsh-drop-in/`
3. Restart `dsh web`
