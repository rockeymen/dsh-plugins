**A Claude Science–style research workbench for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) — for genomics / pathogens / human health / bioinformatics projects.**

> One-liner: **dsh-science** — Claude Science-style research workbench for DSH: ReAct research-loop engine (research_* tools), versioned artifacts with provenance (artifact_* tools), and 10 science skills for genomics / pathogens / bioinformatics.

- **ReAct research loop engine** — `research_init` / `research_state` / `research_hypothesis` / `research_experiment` / `research_findings` / `research_phase` / `research_review`, persisted in a `research-manifest.json` state machine (Question → Hypothesis → Experiment → Observe → Analyze → Conclude → Next Question).
- **Versioned artifacts with provenance** — `artifact_save` / `artifact_list` / `artifact_show` / `artifact_reproduce`: every result saved as `artifacts/<name>/v<N>/` with per-file SHA-256, `artifact.json` provenance (command / inputs / notes / environment) and an append-only `provenance.md`.
- **10 science skills** — research-loop, science-project-setup, artifact-provenance, scientific-reviewer, literature-connector, parallel-delegation, manuscript-writing, bioinformatics-toolkit, conda-environments, data-inventory.

Both engine plugins are **zero-dependency** (Node built-ins only) and register plain cordis tools. Installable either as a profile bundle (`dsh plugin add`) or as an agent preset (`科学模式`).

## Install

### Option A — profile bundle (community standard)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-science            # after npm publish
# or straight from GitHub:
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:biociao/dsh-science"
```

Restart the profile (or refresh the Web GUI). The bundle inserts the two engines
into the profile layer stack; the `research_*` / `artifact_*` tools become
available to every agent on that profile.

### Option B — agent preset (full 科学模式 experience, per-agent)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biociao/dsh-science ~/.dsh/.agent-presets/science
# or from a local checkout:
bash scripts/install.sh          # copy   (or: bash scripts/install.sh link)
```

Then create a session in the DSH Web GUI and pick the **科学模式** preset — the
preset carries the research persona + engines with per-agent scoping.

### Skills

The 10 skills are discovered automatically from a project's `.dsh/skills/`
(drop this repo's `skills/` into your project), or install them machine-wide:

```bash
bash scripts/install-skills.sh          # -> ~/.dsh/skills (respects $DSH_HOME)
```

## Quick start (first session)

1. `research_init` — create `research-manifest.json` + the project skeleton
   (`experiments/ literature/ artifacts/ analyses/ figures/ manuscript/ reviews/ data/ envs/`).
2. Read `research_state` at the start of every session; the loop state persists
   across sessions.
3. Run the loop: `research_hypothesis` (H1/H2/…) → `research_experiment` (E01/…,
   creates `experiments/<id>/{design.md,log.md,code/,results/}`) → run code →
   `research_findings` (appends to log.md, updates hypothesis status, advances
   the loop) → `artifact_save` for anything worth citing or reproducing.
4. For key claims: extract the claim, have a review subagent check it against the
   execution records (see the `scientific-reviewer` skill), archive with
   `research_review` (writes `reviews/R0n/report.md`).

```

## Verification

```bash
node scripts/smoke-test.mjs     # engine logic + end-to-end loop against a temp workspace
bash test/verify-bundle.sh      # pnpm pack -> isolated profile -> install -> boot check
```

Both are part of the release checklist and are safe to run in CI (the smoke test
writes only to a temp workspace; the bundle test uses an isolated `$DSH_HOME`).

## FAQ

**Why subpath exports and not relative paths in the bundle?**
`dsh plugin add` installs the package into the profile and its `cordis.patch.yml`
rows join the profile composition. The profile loader resolves a row `name`
relative to the **profile directory** (not the package), so `./engines/x.mjs`
fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Referencing `dsh-science/engines/x.mjs`
(subpath export, `exports` in `package.json`) resolves from the profile's
`node_modules` and works — verified experimentally on dsh `0.1.0-rc.6`.
The agent-preset mount, by contrast, resolves relative names from the preset
directory, which is why `preset/agent.cordis.yml` can use `./engines/*.mjs`.

**Bundle or preset — which should I use?**
- Bundle: tools available to every agent on the profile; one command to install.
- Preset: the full 科学模式 experience (research persona, per-agent scoping).
  The persona row in `cordis.patch.yml` is commented out because a profile-wide
  persona would apply to all agents — uncomment it before publishing if that is
  what you want.

**Where do the skills come from?**
A project's `.dsh/skills/` is auto-discovered; `scripts/install-skills.sh` puts
them machine-wide in `~/.dsh/skills` (respecting `$DSH_HOME`).

## Development

```bash
bash scripts/sync-engines.sh    # after editing engines/*.mjs — keeps preset/engines in sync
node scripts/smoke-test.mjs     # logic + static package checks
bash test/verify-bundle.sh      # end-to-end bundle install + boot
```
