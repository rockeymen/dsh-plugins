## Add a plugin

Additions are welcome. Please read [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). The English catalog in this README is maintained by hand. Add matching bilingual metadata to [`catalog/plugins.json`](catalog/plugins.json) to update the Simplified Chinese mirror, then run:

```bash
python scripts/generate_readmes.py
python scripts/generate_readmes.py --check
```

The first command regenerates the Simplified Chinese mirror; the second validates its catalog data and verifies that mirror is current.

## Catalog rules

- The plugin must be relevant to DeepSeek Harness or provide clear installation/integration instructions for it.
- Entries need a stable public URL, a concise factual description, and both English and Simplified Chinese copy.
- Keep entries vendor-neutral, useful, and non-duplicative.
- Do not include secrets, affiliate links, unmaintained forks without context, or projects that primarily distribute malware, credential theft, or policy-violating automation.
