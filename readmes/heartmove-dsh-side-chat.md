# dsh-side-chat — 侧边聊天 (Side chat)

A [DSH](https://www.deepseek.com) web plugin that lets you select part of a
conversation and ask about it in a **side chat** — a dedicated chat opened in a
right-side panel, scoped to the conversation it was started from. Side-chat AI
replies can also be **brought back to the main conversation** (directly or as a
summary, into the composer draft or as a collapsed context row).

## What it does

- **Select text → ask in a side chat.** Select any part of a message and a
  floating button *"Ask in side chat"* appears. The selected text is carried
  into the side chat automatically.
- **Per-conversation isolation.** Each side chat is a hidden ordinary DSH
  session (`meta.parentSession` links it to the conversation that started it,
  and the session is archived so it never appears in the main session list).
  Every conversation gets its own side chat.
- **Inherits main-conversation context.** The side chat is aware of the
  conversation it was started from and its working directory, and inherits the
  main conversation's model, thinking effort, and permission preset by default.
- **Model / effort / permission are adjustable.** A two-level model menu
  (provider → model → effort) and a permission menu are copied from the main
  conversation, so each side chat can be tuned independently.
- **"Look up workspace / parent when needed" switch** (default off). When on,
  the side chat may read files from the workspace and the parent conversation
  when it needs more information.
- **Normal conversation capabilities.** Markdown replies, thinking/reasoning
  display, image attachments (paste / drag-and-drop), send/stop controls, and
  thinking-duration display — all reuse the same UI primitives as the main
  conversation.
- **Bring AI replies back to the main conversation.** Every assistant reply in
  the side chat can be brought into the current main conversation: select part
  of it with the mouse, or insert the whole reply in one click. Either way you
  can choose **"Insert directly"** (verbatim) or **"Summarize & insert"** (the
  side chat's inherited model summarizes it first). Where it lands is
  configurable: **into the composer draft**, or **as a collapsed context row**
  (injected as context — not into the composer, never sent).
- **Ask about the current question dialog.** When the main conversation shows a
  question dialog (the agent asking you something), the side panel automatically
  lists the question and each option (no manual text selection needed). Each
  question has "Bring all" and each option has "Bring", both offering to
  **continue an existing side chat** or **start a new one**. The list can be
  **collapsed / expanded**, and items can be **deleted individually or all at
  once** (deleted items stay gone).
- **Deletable side chats.** Each entry in the side-chat list can be deleted
  individually, or all of them at once via "Delete all".
- **Resizable, collapsible panel.** Drag to resize (280–720 px), collapse and
  expand; no close button.
- **Language-aware.** The plugin follows DSH's language setting (Chinese /
  English).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 20
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- DSH ≥ `0.1.0-rc.6` (the harness `engines.dsh` constraint)

## Build

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

`pnpm build` clears `lib/`, runs `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` for type
declarations, then bundles the host (`lib/index.js`) and client
(`lib/client.js` + `lib/client-registry.js`) with tsdown.

## Deploy

DSH web loads external plugins from the active profile. This package is a
**bundle**: its `package.json` declares `dsh.bundle.patch` →
[`cordis.patch.yml`](./cordis.patch.yml), whose `insert` row mounts the plugin.
That declaration is what lets `dsh plugin add` install the package *and*
activate it in one step.

### Install from GitHub

```bash
npx -p @deepseek-ai/dsh dsh plugin --profile web add github:heartmove/dsh-side-chat
```

`dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm inside `~/.dsh/profiles/web/`, then reconciles the
bundle into the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` layer list. A git install
fetches sources, so pnpm runs the package's `prepare` script (`tsdown`) to build
`lib/` from `src/` after checkout.

pnpm ≥ 10 refuses to run a git dependency's `prepare` script until it is
allowlisted, so the first `add` fails with an "Ignored build scripts" hint. Copy
the exact package key pnpm printed into the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
(`~/.dsh/profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml`):

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-side-chat: true
```

then re-run the `add`. That allowance means "run this package's code on my
machine at install time" — only allow packages whose source you trust, and pin a
commit (`github:heartmove/dsh-side-chat#<sha>`) so a later push cannot silently
change what runs.

Restart `dsh web`, then hard-refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R).

### Install from a local checkout

From the directory that contains this checkout:

```bash
npx -p @deepseek-ai/dsh dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-side-chat
```

pnpm links the checkout and `dsh` activates the bundle the same way.

### Manual link

To manage the profile by hand, link the package and list it as a bundle in
`~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json` (the bundle's own `cordis.patch.yml` supplies
the loader row, so no `insert` entry is needed):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dsh-side-chat": "link:D:\\path\\to\\dsh-side-chat"
  },
  "dsh": {
    "profile": {
      "bundles": ["@deepseek-ai/dsh-base", "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app", "dsh-side-chat"]
    }
  }
}
```

(On POSIX systems use `link:/path/to/dsh-side-chat`.) Then run `pnpm install`
in the profile directory and restart `dsh web`.

## Usage

1. Select part of any message in the main conversation.
2. A floating **"Ask in side chat"** button appears — click it.
   - If a side chat already exists for this conversation, you'll also see
     **"Continue active side chat"**.
3. The right-side panel opens (or expands) with the selected text staged in the
   composer.
4. Adjust **model / effort** and **permission**, and toggle **"Look up workspace
   / parent when needed"** as desired.
5. Send. The reply streams back with markdown rendering and, where applicable,
   a "Think" row for the model's reasoning.
6. Drag the panel's left edge to resize, or use the collapse/expand control.

### Sending behavior

By default (`sendImmediately` on), selecting text **sends it immediately** and
appends your configured **default prompt**. Turn `sendImmediately` off in
settings to stage the selection as an attachment instead, so you can review and
edit before sending.

### Bring replies back to the main conversation

Assistant replies in the side chat can be brought into the current main
conversation (**never sent**):

1. **Bring a selection.** Select part of an assistant reply in the side chat,
   then choose **"Insert directly"** (verbatim) or **"Summarize & insert"** (the
   side chat's inherited model summarizes it first) from the floating menu.
2. **Bring the whole reply.** Each assistant reply has **"Insert directly"** and
   **"Summarize & insert"** buttons under its text, for inserting the full reply
   (or its summary) in one click.
3. Per the **bring-back target** setting, the content is either **appended to
   the main composer draft** (edit before sending) or **injected as a collapsed
   context row** (source-tagged, not into the composer; the model sees it next
   turn).

### Ask about the current question dialog

When the main conversation shows a question dialog, the side panel automatically
lists the question and its options:

1. While the panel is closed, a **floating entry** appears beside the dialog's
   header — click it to open the panel.
2. Each question has "Bring all" and each option has "Bring", both offering to
   **continue an existing side chat** or **start a new one**.
3. The list can be **collapsed / expanded**, and items can be **deleted
   individually or all at once** (deleted items stay gone).

### Delete side chats

Each entry in the side-chat list has a "×" delete button; "Delete all" at the
top-right removes every side chat of the current conversation.

## Settings

Open DSH **Settings → 侧边聊天 (Side chat)** to configure:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lookupDefault` | off | Whether the "look up workspace / parent" switch is on by default for new side chats. |
| `sendImmediately` | on | Whether selecting text sends it immediately, or stages it as an attachment. |
| `defaultPrompt` | *(empty)* | Extra prompt appended when the selection is sent immediately. |
| `bringMode` | `draft` | Where brought-back content lands: `draft` into the composer, or `context` as a collapsed context row. |

Preferences are stored in the DSH settings namespace `dsh-side-chat`.
